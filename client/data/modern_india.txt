Sources for the History
of Modern India
An abundance of historical material is available for studying
India from the mid-18th century to the mid-20th century. In
constructing the history of modern India, priority needs to
be given to archives. Archives refer to a collection of
historical records and documents, usually primary source
documents, i.e., those documents that have been created as
a necessary part of some activity—administrative, legal,
social or commercial. They are unique/original documents,
not consciously written or created to convey information to
a future generation. An important part of archives relating
to modern India are the official records, i.e., the papers of
government agencies at various levels.

The records of the East India Company provide a
detailed account of trading conditions during the period
1600-1857. When the British crown took over the
administration, it also kept a large variety and volume of
official records. These records help historians to trace every
important development stage-by-stage and follow the
processes of decision-making and the psychology of the
policy-makers. The records of the other European East India
companies (the Portuguese, Dutch and French) are also
useful for constructing the history of the 17th and 18th
centuries. They are primarily important from the point of
view of economic history, but much can be gathered from
them about the political set-up as well.
There are also many contemporary and semicontemporary works such as memoirs, biographies and travel
accounts which give us interesting as well as useful glimpses
into the history of the 18th and early 19th centuries.
Newspapers and journals made their appearance in the later
part of the 18th century, and they provide very valuable
information on almost all aspects of the Indian society,
especially in the 19th and 20th centuries. Other sources of
modern Indian history include oral evidence, creative literature
and paintings.

Archival Materials
There are four categories of official records (i) central
government archives, (ii) state government archives, (iii)
records of intermediate and subordinate authorities, and (iv)
judicial records. Apart from these, there are private archives
and archival sources available abroad.

Central Government Archives
The National Archives of India, located in New Delhi,
contains most of the archives of the Government of India.
These provide authentic and reliable source materials on
varied aspects of modern Indian history. The records with
the National Archives come under various groups, representing

Sources for the History of Modern India  3

different branches of the secretariat at different stages of
its development. This happened as the work of the East India
Company was distributed among various branches—public or
general, revenue, political, military, secret, commercial,
judicial, education, etc.—and a separate set of records was
kept for each of these branches or departments. With the
appointment of James Rennell as the first Surveyor General
of Bengal in 1767, the Survey of India began to scientifically
map the unknown regions of the country and its bordering
lands. The records of the Survey of India as well as the
journals and memoirs of the surveyors provide valuable
information not only on geographical matters but also on
contemporary socio-economic conditions and other important
historical aspects.
The proceedings of the public, judicial and legislative
departments provide ample data for studying the social and
religious policies of the colonial government. The
government’s policies on education and the growth of the
education system during the colonial rule are mentioned in
the educational records of the central archives. The papers
bearing on the emergence of the nationalist movement were
part of the public series of the home department records but,
in 1907, a new series of records—Home Political—was
started to deal exclusively with political and communal
issues. The records of the Reforms Office are very useful
for an analytical study of the constitutional developments
from 1920 to 1937.

Archives of the State Governments

The source material in the state archives comprise the
records of (i) the former British Indian provinces, (ii) the
erstwhile princely states which were incorporated in the
Indian Union after 1947, and (iii) the foreign administrations
other than those of the British. Apart from these, the records
of those Indian powers which were taken over by the British,
for instance, the archives of the Kingdom of Lahore (popularly
known as Khalsa Darbar records from 1800 to 1849), are
important source material. Another important collection of

4

4  

the pre-British public archives in India is the Peshwa Daftar
housed in the Alienation Office, Pune. It forms the most
valuable single source for the study of Maratha history for
a period of almost a century before the fall of the Peshwas.
For studying the history of the princely states of
Rajasthan, viz., Jaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Udaipur, etc., the
archives of these states, now housed in the Rajasthan State
Archives at Bikaner, are valuable. Similarly, the history of
Dogra rule from 1846 in Jammu and Kashmir can be studied
in the valuable collection of state papers housed at Jammu.
The other significant archives of the princely states are those
of Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal and Rewa, all in Madhya Pradesh,
Travancore and Cochin in Kerala, Mysore in Karnataka and
Kolhapur in Maharashtra.

Archives of Three Presidencies
The early records of Fort Williams (Bengal Presidency) were
lost during the sack of Calcutta in 1756, but the archives
of the Bengal presidency after the British victory at Plassey
have survived more or less in a complete series, which are
partly available in the National Archives of India and partly
in the State Archives of West Bengal. The records of the
Madras Presidency begin from AD 1670 and include records
of the Governor and Council of Fort St. George. In these
records there is plenty of information bearing on the rise
of the English East India Company as a political power in
the south and in the Deccan, including the Anglo-French
struggle and the English conflicts with other Indian powers.
The archives of Bombay Presidency, housed in the Maharashtra
Secretariat Record Office, Mumbai, are extremely useful in
studying the history of Western India—Maharashtra, Gujarat,
Sindh and the Kannada-speaking districts of the erstwhile
Bombay Presidency which were incorporated in Mysore in
1956.

Archives of Other European Powers
The archives related to the Portuguese preserved in Goa,
mainly belonging to the period from 1700 to 1900, are

Sources for the History of Modern India  5

valuable for the history of Portuguese possessions in India.
The orders and dispatches from Lisbon received in Goa and
the responses and reports dispatched from India to Portugal
constitute the most significant historical material among the
Portuguese archives. The Dutch records of Cochin and
Malabar are in the Madras Record Office and those of
Chinsura in the state archives of West Bengal. The French
archives of Chandernagore and Pondicherry (now Puducherry)
were taken to Paris by the French authorities before they
relinquished these settlements. The archives of the Danish
possessions were also transferred to Copenhagen when the
Danes sold Tranquebar and Serampore to the English East
India Company in 1845. The remaining Danish records,
mainly relating to Tranquebar (1777-1845), are now housed
in the Madras Record Office.

Judicial Records

Housed in the Madras Record Office, the archives of the
Mayor’s Court at Fort St. George, beginning from AD 1689,
are the earliest available judicial archives. The pre-Plassey
records of the Mayor’s Court at Fort Williams have been
lost, but those for the years 1757-73 are kept in the record
room of the Calcutta High Court, along with the archives of
the Supreme Court of Bengal (1774-1861). Similarly, the
records of the Mayor’s Court at Bombay established in 1728
are available in the Maharashtra Secretariat Record Office
which also has the custody of the archives of the Bombay
Recorder’s Court and the Supreme Court. Apart from
containing the proceedings and minutes, this category of
records contains copies of wills, probates, and letters of
administration which are useful for genealogical studies and
for investigations pertaining to the state of society and
economic conditions in the respective regions.

Published Archives

The most significant archival publications are the Parliamentary
Papers which include many excerpts from the records of the
East India Company and the Government of India under the

6

6  

Crown. The reports of the parliamentary select committees;
various royal commissions constituted on specific subjects
like education, civil reforms and famines, and the parliamentary
debates on the Indian empire are indispensable. The
proceedings of the Indian and provincial legislatures, the
weekly gazettes published by the central and the provincial
governments and collections of laws and regulations issued
from time to time also serve as useful source material for
historical research.

Private Archives

Private archives comprise papers and documents of individuals
and families of note, who played a significant role in the
development of modern India. The papers of eminent leaders
of the nationalist movement and the records of organisations
like the Indian National Congress are housed in the Nehru
Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi. The archives
of banks, business houses and chambers of commerce are
extremely helpful in the study of economic changes.

Foreign Repositories
A vast body of historical material related to the history of
modern India is available in the repositories of erstwhile
imperialist powers, who ruled in different parts of the Indian
subcontinent as well as in some other countries. In England,
the India Office Records, London and the records kept in
the British Museum are very valuable. The India Office
Records possesses various important documents: the minutes
of the Courts of Directors and the General Court of the East
India Company and various committees constituted from time
to time; the minutes and correspondence of the Board of
Control or the Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of
India; and the records of the Secretary of State and the India
Council. The British Museum possesses collections of
papers of British viceroys, secretaries of states and other
high ranked civil and military officials who were posted in
India. The archives of the missionary societies, for instance,
of the Church Missionary Society of London, provide insight

Sources for the History of Modern India  7

into the educational and social development in pre-independent
India.
The Archives Nationale, Paris, and the Archives of the
French Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Colonies and War, have
records that throw light on the history of French possessions
as well as the socio-political conditions. The records of the
Dutch East India Company is available in Rijksarchief, The
Hague, and that of the Danish and Portuguese are kept in
Copenhagen and Lisbon, respectively.
Apart from the archives of the European nations, the
archives preserved in Pakistan are of utmost importance. The
West Pakistan Record Office, Lahore, Record Office,
Peshawar, records available in Sind, etc., give information
about the regional history of the Indian subcontinent besides
shedding light on India’s relations with Afghanistan, Iran and
other neighbouring countries in the colonial era.

Biographies, Memoirs and
Travel Accounts
Many travellers, traders, missionaries and civil servants who
came to India, have left accounts of their experiences and
their impressions of various parts of India. An important
group among these writers was that of the missionaries who
wrote to encourage their respective societies to send more
missionaries to India for the purpose of envangelising its
inhabitants. In this genre, Bishop Heber’s Journal and Abbe
Dubois’s Hindu Manners and Customs, provide useful
information on the socio-economic life of India during the
period of decline of the Indian powers and the rise of the
British.
Some of the famous British travellers who wrote travel
accounts were—George Forster, Benjamin Heyne, James
Burnes (Narrative of a Visit to the Court of Sinde),
Alexander Burnes (Travels Into Bokhara), C.J.C. Davidson
(Diary of the Travels and Adventures in Upper India), and
John Butler (Travels and Adventures in the Province of

8

8  

Assam). Famous non-British travellers who wrote about India
include Victor Jacquemont (Letters from India describing
a journey in the British Dominions of India, Tibet, Lahore
and Cashmere during the years 1828-1829—1831), Baron
Charles (Travels in Kashmir and the Punjab), and William
Moorcroft. These travel accounts are indispensable and
generally reliable sources for constructing the history of
modern India, especially as they supplement the official
papers.

Newspapers and Journals
Newspapers and journals of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, published in English as well as in the different
vernacular languages, form an important and authentic source
of information for the construction of the history of modern
India. The first attempts to publish newspapers in India were
made by the disgruntled employees of the English East India
Company who sought to expose the malpractices of private
trade. For instance, in 1776, William Bolts, being censured
by the Court of Directors for private trading, resigned from
the Company and announced his intention to publish a
newspaper. The official response to Bolts’ scheme was strong
and his plan ended before materialising. In 1780, James
Augustus Hickey published the first newspaper in India
entitled The Bengal Gazette or Calcutta General Advertiser.
Hickey’s press was seized within two years, owing to his
outspoken criticism of government officials. Afterwards,
many publications appeared such as The Calcutta Gazette
(1784), The Madras Courier (1788) and The Bombay
Herald (1789). The newspapers and journals of the early
period primarily aimed at catering to the intellectual
entertainment of the Europeans and Anglo-Indians.
From the second half of the 19th century, many
powerful newspapers appeared, edited/published by
distinguished and fearless journalists. Interestingly, nearly

Sources for the History of Modern India  9

one-third of the founding fathers of the Indian National
Congress in 1885 were journalists. Some of their publications
were: The Hindu and Swadesamitran under the editorship
of G. Subramaniya Iyer, Kesari and Mahratta under Bal
Gangadhar Tilak, Bengalee under Surendranath Banerjea,
Amrita Bazaar Patrika under Sisir Kumar Ghosh and Motilal
Ghosh, Sudharak under Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Indian
Mirror under N.N. Sen, Voice of India under Dadabhai
Naoroji, Hindustan and Advocate under G.P. Varma. The
Tribune and Akhbar-i-Am in Punjab, Indu Prakash, Dnyan
Prakash, Kal and Gujarati in Bombay, and Som Prakash
Banganivasi and Sadharani in Bengal were other noted
newspapers of the time. Indian nationalists and revolutionaries
living abroad published newspapers and journals—Indian
Sociologist (London, Shyamji Krishnavarma), Bande Matram
(Paris, Madam Cama), Talwar (Berlin, Virendranath
Chattopadhyay), and Ghadar (San Francisco, Lala Hardayal)—
to infuse a feeling of nationalism among Indians living
abroad.
Newspapers depict almost all aspects of life in colonial
India from around the 1870s onwards. From the 1920s
onwards, newspapers tracked the major events during the
freedom struggle. However, newspaper accounts cannot be
seen as unprejudiced or completely objective. The accounts
that were published in a newspaper in London by the proBritish Raj people were bound to be different from the report
in an Indian nationalist paper.

Oral Evidence
Oral history refers to the construction of history with the
help of non-written sources, for instance, personal
reminiscence. Oral sources allow historians to broaden the
boundaries of their discipline and corroborate their findings
from other sources of history. However, many historians
remain sceptical of the veracity of oral history.

10

Creative Literature
The most significant outcome of the Indo-European contact
was the literary genre of the novel which emerged in the latter
half of the 19th century. The first important writer of that
period was the Bengali novelist, Bankim Chandra Chatterji
(1838-94). His novels are mostly historical, the best known
among them being Anandamath (1882), noted for its powerful
lyric ‘Vandemataram’ and depiction of the Sanyasi Revolt
(1760s). His last novel Rajasimha can be called the grand
finale to his remarkable career. Icharam Suryaram Desai
(1853-1912) was a fine scholar of medieval Gujarati literary
history. His first novel Hind ane Britannia was one of the
earliest Indian novels with political overtones. Tamil writers
like Girija Devi and Ramatirthammal, who wrote Mohana
Rajani (1931) and Dasikalin Mosavalai (1936) respectively,
also made the novel an effective vehicle of social experience.
G.V. Krishna Rao’s Keelubommalu (The Puppets, 1956) in
Telugu was concerned with the moral aspects and behaviour
of the rural people. Vaikom Muhammad Basheer (19101994) was one of the eminent writers in Malayalam whose
famous novel Balyakalasakhi (The Childhood Friends, 1944)
was a tragic tale of love. Similarly, Thakazhi Siva Sankara
Pillai became prominent for his two extremely well written
works in Malayalam, Tottiyude Makan (Son of a Scavenger,
1948) and Chemmeen (Shrimps, 1956). Despite having
different educational backgrounds and social outlooks, all
these writers shared a strong sense of realism and deep
interest in the life of the marginalised and oppressed sections
of the society. These novels give a picture of the social
milieu of the days they relate to.

Painting
Some information on the socio-economic, political and
cultural life during the colonial period can be obtained from
the paintings of that period. The Company Paintings, also

Sources for the History of Modern India  11

referred as ‘Patna Kalam’ emerged under the patronage of
the East India Company. They picturise the people and scenes
as they existed at the time. Trades, festivals, dances and the
attire of people are visible in these works. Company paintings
continued to be popular in the 19th century until the
introduction of photography in India in the 1840s.
The pictorial images produced by the British and
Indians—paintings, pencil drawings, etchings, posters, cartoons
and bazaar prints—are especially important records of the
great revolt of 1857. The British pictures offer images that
were meant to provoke a range of different emotions and
reactions. Some of them commemorate the British heroes
who saved the English and repressed the rebels. Relief of
Lucknow, painted by Thomas Jones Barker in 1859, is one
such example. Another painting of this period, In Memoriam
by Joseph Noel Paton, recorded in painting two years of the
revolt of 1857. One can see English women and children
huddled in a circle, looking helpless and innocent, seemingly
waiting for the inevitable—dishonour, violence and death.
These paintings of the mutiny period are important for the
historian to interpret and understand the worldviews of the
British and the Indians regarding this major event.
Kalighat painting that came to the fore in Calcutta in
the nineteenth century depicted not only mythological figures
but also ordinary people engaged in their everyday lives. The
latter pictures captured the social changes taking place in the
Calcutta of the time. These paintings made a comment on
social evils of the time; some of these paintings satirised
certain modes adopted by the people of the time.
In the last decades of the nineteenth century, a new art
movement emerged which received its primary stimulus from
the growing nationalism in India. Artists like Nandalal Bose
and Raja Ravi Varma were representatives of this new trend.
In the rise of the Bengal School led by Abanindranath Tagore
(nephew of Rabindranath Tagore), E.B. Havell (who joined
the art school in Calcutta as principal) and Ananda Kentish
Coomaraswamy (son of an important Tamil political leader

12

12  

in Sri Lanka) played a vital role. Though many of the paintings
of this new trend primarily focused on themes of Indian
mythology and cultural heritage, they are important sources
for studying the modern art movement in India and for the
art historians.

Major Approaches to the
History of Modern India
Looking at how histories are written is part of the study of
the intellectual history of the period under discussion and
can provide a variety of ideas and explanations. The starting
point in the history of a society, therefore, has to be a
familiarity with its historiography—the study of historical
interpretation. This provides recognition of the intellectual
context of history, instead of seeing history as just a narration
of events. The modern history of India, for the convenience
of understanding, can be read broadly under four approaches—
the Colonial (or the Imperialist), Nationalist, Marxist, and
Subaltern—each with its own distinct characteristics and
modes of interpretation. However, there are other approaches—
Communalist, Cambridge, Liberal and Neo-liberal, and
Feminist interpretations—which have also influenced historical
writing on modern India.
View
The production of histories of India has become very frequent
in recent years and may well call for some explanations… The
reason is a two-fold one: changes in the Indian scene requiring
a reinterpretation of the facts and changes in the attitudes of
historians about the essential elements of Indian history.
—Percival Spear

Colonial Approach/
Historiography
For the major part of the 19th century the Colonial School
occupied a high position in India. The term ‘colonial approach’
has been used in two senses. One relates to the history of
the colonial countries, while the other refers to the works
which were influenced by the colonial ideology of domination.
It is in the second sense that most historians today write
about the colonial historiography. In fact, the practice of
writing about the colonial countries by the colonial officials
was related to the desire for domination and justification of
the colonial rule. Hence, in most such historical works there
was criticism of indigenous society and culture.
Simultaneously, there was praise for the Western culture and
values and glorification of the individuals who established the
colonial empires. The histories of India written by James
Mill, Mountstuart Elphinstone, Vincent Smith and many
others are pertinent examples of the colonial historiographical
trend. Certain characteristics common to most of the works
of these historians are the following:
(i) ‘Orientalist’ representation of India;
(ii) the opinion that the British brought unity to India;
(iii) the notions of Social Darwinism—the English
considered themselves superior to the ‘natives’ and
the fittest to rule;
(iv) India viewed as a stagnant society which required
guidance from the British (White Man’s burden); and
(v) establishing Pax Britannica to bring law and order
and peace to a bickering society.

Nationalist Historiography/
Approach
The nationalist approach to Indian history can be described
as one which tends to contribute to the growth of nationalist

Major Approaches to the History of Modern India  15

feelings and to unify people in the face of religious, caste,
or linguistic differences or class differentiation. This approach
looks at the national movement as a movement of the Indian
people, which grew out of the growing awareness among all
people of the exploitative nature of colonial rule. This
approach developed as a response to and in confrontation with
the colonial approach. It should be noted that the nationalist
historians of modern India didn’t exist before 1947. Before
1947, nationalist historiography mainly dealt with the ancient
and medieval periods of Indian history. However, in the last
quarter of the 19th century, a detailed and scientific critique
of colonialism for the adverse economic aspects of alien rule
was developed by nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, M.G.
Ranade, G.V. Joshi, R.C. Dutt, K.T. Telang, G.K. Gokhale,
and D.E. Wacha. The only accounts of the national movement
was by nationalist leaders (not historians) such as R.G.
Pradhan, A.C. Mazumdar, J.L. Nehru and Pattabhi Sitaramayya.
R.C. Majumdar and Tara Chand are noted nationalist historians
of modern India.

Marxist Historiography/
Approach
The beginning of the Marxist approach in India was heralded
by two classic books—Rajni Palme Dutt’s India Today and
A.R. Desai’s Social Background of Indian Nationalism.
Originally written for the famous Left Book Club in England,
India Today, first published in 1940 in England, was later
published in India in 1947. A.R. Desai’s Social Background
of Indian Nationalism, was first published in 1948.
Unlike the imperialist/colonial approach, the Marxist
historians clearly see the primary contradiction between the
interests of the colonial masters and the subject people, as
well as the process of the nation-in-the-making. Unlike the
nationalists, they also take full note of the inner contradictions
between the different sections of the people of the Indian
society. However, some of them, particularly Rajni Palme

16

16  

Dutt, were unable to fully integrate their treatment of the
primary anti-imperialist contradiction and the secondary
inner contradictions and tended to counterbalance the antiimperialist struggle with the class or social struggle. They
tend to see the national movement as a structured bourgeois
movement, if not the bourgeoisie’s movement, and miss its
open ended and all-class character. Another noted Marxist
historian, who made a critique of R.P. Dutt’s paradigm, is
Sumit Sarkar; he considers Dutt’s paradigm as a “simplistic
version of the Marxian class approach”. He looks at the
nationalist leaders in the light of intelligentsia which acts as
a “kind of proxy for as yet passive social forces with which
it had little organic connection”.
A.R. Desai traces the growth of the national movement
in five phases, each phase based on particular social classes
which supported and sustained it.

Subaltern Approach/
Historiography
This school of thought began in the early 1980s under the
editorship of Ranajit Guha, as a critique of the existing
historiography, which was faulted for ignoring the voice of
the people. Right from the beginning, subaltern historiography
took the position that the entire tradition of Indian
historiography had had an elitist bias. For the subaltern
historians, the basic contradiction in Indian society in the
colonial epoch was between the elite, both Indian and foreign,
on the one hand, and the subaltern groups, on the other, and
not between colonialism and the Indian people. However, they
do not subscribe to the Marxist theory of the nature of the
exploitation by the nationalist movement: they point out that
the Indian society of the time could not be seen in terms
of class alone, as capitalism in the country was just nascent
at the time. This school sees nationalism as exploitative in
terms of caste, gender, religious and creed divisions.
Nationalism, say the subalterns, ignored the internal

Major Approaches to the History of Modern India  17
View
A few historians have of late initiated a new trend, described
by its proponents as subaltern, which dismisses all previous
historical writing, including that based on a Marxist perspective,
as elite historiography, and claims to replace this old, ‘blinkered’
historiography with what it claims is a new people’s or subaltern
approach.
—Bipan Chandra

contradictions within the society as well as what the
marginalised represented or had to say. They believe that the
Indian people were never united in a common anti-imperialist
struggle, that there was no such entity as the Indian national
movement. Instead, they assert, there were two distinct
movements or streams: the real anti-imperialist stream of the
subalterns and the bogus national movement of the elite. The
elite streams, led by the ‘official’ leadership of the Indian
National Congress, were little more than a cloak for the
struggle for power among the elite.

Communalist Approach
The historians of this school, relying completely on the
colonial historiography of medieval India and colonial era
textbooks, viewed Hindus and Muslims as permanent hostile
groups whose interests were mutually different and
antagonistic to each other. This view was not only reflected
in the writings of the historians but also took a more virulent
form in the hands of the communal political leaders. In their
view, India’s medieval history was one long story of HinduMuslim conflict. As a corollary of this view, it was then
argued that the 19th- and 20th-century Muslims had the
‘happy’ and ‘proud’ everpresent memory of having been the
ruling class, while Hindus had the ‘sad’ and ‘humiliating’
memory of having been the subject race. This, ultimately,
developed mutual hatred among these groups often resulting
in communal riots and, in the end led to the partition of
India.

18

18  

Cambridge School
According to this school of thought, the fundamental
contradiction under colonial rule was not between imperialism
and the Indian people, but among the Indians themselves.
Further, Indian nationalism was not the product of a struggle
of the Indian people against colonial exploitation, but what
arose from conflict among the Indians for getting the benefits
given to them by the British rulers. The leaders of the national
movement, according to this school, were inspired by the
quest for power and material benefits. This approach has been
criticised by many scholars on the ground that it takes the
mind or ideals out of human behaviour and reduces nationalism
to ‘animal politics’.

Liberal and Neo-Liberal
Interpretations
According to this interpretation, the economic exploitation
of the colonies was not beneficial to the British people as
a whole. The availability of markets for British industrial
goods in the colonial world and capital investment in overseas
markets (like laying of railways in India) might have actually
discouraged domestic investment and delayed the development
of the ‘new’ industries in Britain. The proponents of this
school of thought are Patrick O’Brian, Hopkins and Cain.

Feminist Historiography
The shift in terms of the writing of women’s history began
with the women’s movement of the 1970s which provided
the context and impetus for the emergence of women’s
studies in India. Very soon, women’s history broadened and
assumed the more complex shape of gender history. In the
early years, the endeavour was to write a history of women
to supplement the writings of mainstream history. Also, an
attempt was made to research and compile an archive of

Major Approaches to the History of Modern India  19

women’s writing. An important area of research has been
analysis of the way in which colonial structures, such as the
legal structure, affected women’s lives. Women’s vulnerability
due to the denial of ownership of productive resources has
been focused on, in the analysis of how progressive laws
shaped gender relations. In the colonial period, two works
based upon the women’s question in India—The High Caste
Hindu Woman (1887) by Pandita Ramabai, and Mother India
(1927) by Katherine Mayo—attracted international attention.
Summary
Different Approaches
Colonial Approach is influenced by the colonial ideology of
domination. It focuses on criticism of indigenous society and
culture, and praises the Western culture and values. James
Mill, Vincent Smith etc., followed this approach.
Nationalist Approach evolved as a response to and in confrontation
with the colonial approach. Before independence, this school
dealt with the ancient and medieval periods of Indian history,
and not the modern period. After independence this school
focused on modern India. R.C. Majumdar and Tara Chand
belonged to this school.
Marxist Approach focuses on the primary contradiction between
the interests of the colonial masters and the native subjects.
It also takes notice of the inner contradictions between the
different sections of Indian society. R.P. Dutt and A.R. Desai
were noted Marxist historians of India.
Subaltern Approach takes the position that the entire tradition
of Indian historiography has an elitist bias and the role of
the common masses has been neglected. Ranajit Guha
belonged to this school.
Communalist Approach views Hindus and Muslims as permanently
hostile groups whose interests are mutually different and
antagonistic to each other.

20

20  
Cambridge School envisages Indian nationalism as a product
of conflicts among the Indians themselves for getting the
benefits from the British rulers. For them Indian nationalist
leaders were inspired by the greed of power and material
benefits.
Liberal and Neo-liberal Interpretations imply that the economic
exploitation of the colonies was not beneficial to the people
of Britain as it delayed the development of the ‘new’ industries
in Britain.
Feminist Historiography focuses on areas of research that
analyse colonial structures, such as the legal structure, which
affected women’s lives. It also focuses on women’s vulnerability
due to the denial of ownership of productive resources.

Advent of the
Europeans in India
Though we talk of ancient, medieval and modern periods in
history, history is a continuity. It is not always easy to
distinguish clearly when one period ends and another begins.
So if we think of the history of modern India as beginning
with the advent of the Europeans, we need to go back to what
is generally considered the medieval period, i.e., the fifteenth
century itself. Indeed to a time even before the Mughals came
and established their empire.

The Portuguese in India
The Quest for and Discovery of a
Sea Route to India
After the decline of the Roman Empire in the seventh
century, the Arabs had established their domination in Egypt
and Persia. Direct contact between the Europeans and India
declined and, with that, the easy accessibility to the Indian
commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and various precious
stones that were greatly in demand was affected. In 1453,
Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the
ascendant. Merchandise from India went to the European
markets through Arab Muslim intermediaries. The Red Sea
trade route was a state monopoly from which Islamic rulers
earned tremendous revenues. The land routes to India were
also controlled by the Arabs. In the circumstances, the
Europeans were keen to find a direct sea route to India.
Fifteenth-century Europe was gripped by the spirit of
the Renaissance with its call for exploration. At the same
time, Europe made great advances in the art of ship-building
and navigation. Hence, there was an eagerness all over Europe
for adventurous sea voyages to reach the unknown corners
of the East.
The economic development of many regions of Europe
was also progressing rapidly with expansion of land under
cultivation, the introduction of an improved plough, scientific
crop management such as crop rotation, and increased supply
of meat (which called for spices for cooking as well as for
preservation). Prosperity also grew and with it the demand
for oriental luxury goods also increased.
Venice and Genoa which had earlier prospered through
trade in oriental goods were too small to take on the mighty
Ottoman Turks or to take up major exploration on their own.
The north Europeans were ready to aid Portugal and Spain
with money and men, even as the Genoese were ready to
provide ships and technical knowledge. It is also to be noted
that Portugal had assumed the leadership in Christendom’s

Advent of the Europeans in India  23

resistance to Islam even as it had taken on itself the spirit
of exploration that had characterised the Genoese.
Historians have observed that the idea of finding an
ocean route to India had become an obsession for Prince
Henry of Portugal, who was nicknamed the ‘Navigator’; also,
he was keen to find a way to circumvent the Muslim
domination of the eastern Mediterranean and all the routes
that connected India to Europe. Pope Nicholas V gave Prince
Henry a bull in 1454, conferring on him the right to navigate
the “sea to the distant shores of the Orient”, more specifically
“as far as India” in an attempt to fight Islamic influence and
spread the Christian faith. However, Prince Henry died before
his dream became a reality.
In 1497, under the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the
rulers of Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world
between them by an imaginary line in the Atlantic, some
1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. Under the treaty,
Portugal could claim and occupy everything to the east of
the line while Spain could claim everything to the west. The
situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into
the waters around India.
It was in 1487 that the Portuguese navigator,
Bartholomew Dias, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa
and sailed up the eastern coast; he was well convinced that
the long sought after sea route to India had been found. But
it was only ten years later that an expedition of Portuguese
ships set out for India (in 1497) and arrived in India in slightly
less than eleven months’ time, in May 1498.

From Trading to Ruling
Vasco Da Gama
The arrival of three ships under Vasco Da Gama, led by a
Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid, at Calicut in May 1498
profoundly affected the course of Indian history. The Hindu
ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin (Samuthiri), however, had no
apprehensions as to the European’s intentions. As the prosperity
of his kingdom was due to Calicut’s position as an entrepot,

24  

he accorded a friendly reception to Vasco Da Gama. The Arab
traders, who had a good business on the Malabar coast were
apprehensive and were not keen on the Portuguese getting
a hold there.
For centuries, the trading system in the Indian Ocean
had had numerous participants—Indians, Arabs, Africans from
the east coast, Chinese, Javanese, among others—but these
participants had acted according to some tacit rules of
conduct and none had sought overwhelming dominance
though all were in it for profit. The Portuguese changed that:
they wanted to monopolise the hugely profitable eastern trade
by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs.
Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months. When
he returned to Portugal, he carried back with him a rich cargo
and sold the merchandise in the European market at a huge
profit. The importance of direct access to the pepper trade
was made clear by the fact that elsewhere the Europeans, who
had to buy through Muslim middlemen, would have had to
spend ten times as much for the same amount of pepper.
Not surprisingly, other profit-seeking merchants of European
nations were tempted to come to India and trade directly.
A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to
trade for spices; he negotiated and established a factory at
Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500. There was an
incident of conflict when the Portuguese factory at Calicut
was attacked by the locals, resulting in the death of several
Portuguese. In retaliation, Cabral seized a number of Arab
merchant ships anchored in the harbour, and killed hundreds
of their crew besides confiscating their cargo and burning
the ships. Calicut was bombarded by Cabral. Later, Cabral
succeeded in making advantageous treaties with the local
rulers of Cochin and Cannanore.
Vasco da Gama once again came to India in 1501. The
Zamorin declined to exclude the Arab merchants in favour
of the Portuguese when Vasco Da Gama combined commercial
greed with ferocious hostility and wreaked vengeance on Arab
shipping wherever he could. His rupture with the Zamorin

Advent of the Europeans in India  25
View
The landing of Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 ... is generally
regarded as the beginning of a new era in world history, especially
in the relationship between Asia and Europe. Although Asia and
Europe had been in commercial relations with each other since
antiquity, the opening of the direct sea-relations between the two
was not only the fulfilment of an old dream (according to the
Greek historian, Herodotus, the Phoenicians had rounded Africa
in the 6th century BC) it presaged big increase of trade between
the two. This, however, was only one of the objectives of the
Portuguese. For the Portuguese, the opening of a new sea-route
to India would give a big blow to the Muslims, the Arabs and
Turks, who were the traditional enemies of Christianity, and were
posing a new threat to Europe by virtue of the growing military
and naval power of the Turks. A direct sea-link with India would
displace the virtual monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the
trade in eastern goods, especially spices. They also vaguely
hoped by their exploration of Africa they would be able to link
up with the kingdom of the legendary Prior John, and be in a
position to attack the Muslims from two sides. Thus, the
commercial and religious objectives supported and justified each
other.
—Satish Chandra

thus became total and complete. Vasco da Gama set up a
trading factory at Cannanore. Gradually, Calicut, Cannanore
and Cochin became the important trade centres of the
Portuguese.
Gradually, under the pretext of protecting the factories
and their trading activities, the Portuguese got permission to
fortify these centres.
Francisco De Almeida
In 1505, the King of Portugal appointed a governor in India
for a three-year term and equipped the incumbent with
sufficient force to protect the Portuguese interests. Francisco
De Almeida, the newly appointed governor, was asked to
consolidate the position of the Portuguese in India and to
destroy Muslim trade by seizing Aden, Ormuz and Malacca.
He was also advised to build fortresses at Anjadiva, Cochin,
Cannanore and Kilwa. What Almeida, however, encountered

26

yours; and if you do not possess this power, little will avail you
a fortress on shore.
—Francisco De Almeida

along with the opposition of the Zamorin, was a threat from
the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt. Encouraged by the merchants
of Venice whose lucrative commerce was now at risk due
to the Portuguese interference, the Egyptians raised a fleet
in the Red Sea to stop the advance of the Portuguese. In 1507,
the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off
Diu by the combined Egyptian and Gujarat navies, and
Almeida’s son was killed. Next year, Almeida avenged his
defeat by totally crushing the two navies. Almeida’s vision
was to make the Portuguese the master of the Indian Ocean.
His policy was known as the Blue Water Policy (cartaze
system).
Alfonso de Albuquerque
Albuquerque, who succeeded Almeida as the Portuguese
governor in India, was the real founder of the Portuguese
power in the East, a task he completed before his death. He
secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean
by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea.
There were Portuguese strongholds in East Africa, off the
Red Sea, at Ormuz; in Malabar; and at Malacca. The Portuguese,
under Albuquerque bolstered their stranglehold by introducing
a permit system for other ships and exercising control over
the major ship-building centres in the region. The nonavailability of timber in the Gulf and Red Sea regions for
ship-building also helped the Portuguese in their objectives.
Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510
with ease; the principal port of the Sultan of Bijapur became
“the first bit of Indian territory to be under the Europeans
since the time of Alexander the Great”. An interesting feature
of his rule was the abolition of sati.

Advent of the Europeans in India  27
View
Bitter persecution of Muslims was one serious drawback of
Albuquerque’s policy. This could have been due to his resolve
to further the interests of his countrymen by complete extinction
of Muslim commercial interests in the East. During his rule,
Albuquerque did his best to strengthen the fortifications of Goa
and enhance its commercial importance. In order to secure a
permanent Portuguese population in India he encouraged his men
to take Indian wives.
The Gazetteer of India, Vol. II

The Portuguese men who had come on the voyages and
stayed back in India were, from Albuquerque’s day, encouraged
to take local wives. In Goa and the Province of the North
they established themselves as village landlords, often building
new roads and irrigation works, introducing new crops like
tobacco and cashew nut, or better plantation varieties of
coconut besides planting large groves of coconut to meet
the need for coir rigging and cordage. In the cities, such as
Goa and Cochin, they settled as artisans and master-craftsmen,
besides being traders. Most of such Portuguese came to look
upon their new settlements, rather than Portugal, as home.
Nino da Cunha
Nino da Cunha assumed office of the governor of Portuguese
interests in India in November 1529 and almost one year later
shifted the headquarters of the Portuguese government in
India from Cochin to Goa. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, during
his conflict with the Mughal emperor Humayun, secured help
from the Portuguese by ceding to them in 1534 the island
of Bassein with its dependencies and revenues. He also
promised them a base in Diu. However, Bahadur Shah’s
relations with the Portuguese became sour when Humayun
withdrew from Gujarat in 1536. Since the inhabitants of the
town started fighting with the Portuguese, Bahadur Shah
wanted to raise a wall of partition. Opposing this, the
Portuguese started negotiations, in the course of which the
ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed
in 1537. Da Cunha also attempted to increase Portuguese
influence in Bengal by settling many Portuguese nationals
there with Hooghly as their headquarters.

28  

Favourable Conditions for Portuguese
In India, excepting Gujarat, which was ruled by the powerful
Mahmud Begarha (1458-1511), the northern part was much
divided among many small powers. In the Deccan, the
Bahmani Kingdom was breaking up into smaller kingdoms.
None of the powers had a navy worth its name, nor did they
think of developing their naval strength. In the Far East, the
imperial decree of the Chinese emperor limited the navigational
reach of the Chinese ships. As regards the Arab merchants
and ship-owners who until then dominated the Indian Ocean
trade, they had nothing to match the organisation and unity
of the Portuguese. Moreover, the Portuguese had cannons
placed on their ships.

Portuguese State

The general tendency is to underestimate the Portuguese hold
in India. However, the Estado Português da India (State of
the Portuguese India) was in fact a larger element in Indian
history than it is given credit for. Many of the coastal parts
of India had come under Portuguese power within fifty years
of Vasco da Gama’s arrival. The Portuguese had occupied
some sixty miles of coast around Goa. On the west coast
from Mumbai to Daman and Diu to the approaches to Gujarat,
they controlled a narrow tract with four important ports and
hundreds of towns and villages. In the south, they had under
them a chain of seaport fortresses and trading-posts like
Mangalore, Cannanore, Cochin, and Calicut. And though their
power in Malabar was not consolidated, it was enough to
ensure influence or control over the local rulers who held
the spice growing land. The Portuguese established further
military posts and settlements on the east coast at San Thome
(in Chennai) and Nagapatnam (in Andhra). Towards the end
of the sixteenth century, a wealthy settlement had grown at
Hooghly in West Bengal.
Envoys and ambassadors were exchanged between Goa
and many of the major kingdoms in India of the time. Treaties
were signed between Goa and the Deccan sultans in 1570
which were regularly renewed as long as their kingdoms

Advent of the Europeans in India  29

lasted. The Portuguese always had a role to play in the
successive battles for the balance of power between
Vijayanagara and the Deccan sultans, between the Deccanis
and the Mughals, and between the Mughals and the Marathas.
Interestingly, the Portuguese, the first Europeans to
come to India, were also the last to leave this land. It was
1961 before the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman
and Diu from them.
Portuguese Administration in India
The head of the administration was the viceroy who served
for three years, with his secretary and, in later years, a
council. Next in importance came the Vedor da Fazenda,
responsible for revenues and the cargoes and dispatch of
fleets. The fortresses, from Africa to China, were under
captains, assisted by ‘factors’, whose power was increased
by the difficulties of communication and was too often used
for personal ends.
Religious Policy of the Portuguese
The Moors were the bitter enemies of the Portuguese in
North Africa. So were the Arabs. Arriving in the East, the
Portuguese brought with them the same zeal to promote
Christianity and the wish to persecute all Muslims. Intolerant
towards the Muslims, the Portuguese were initially quite
tolerant towards the Hindus. However, over time, after the
introduction of the Inquisition in Goa, there was a change
and Hindus were also persecuted.
But, in spite of this intolerant behaviour, the Jesuits
made a good impression at the court of Akbar, mainly due
to the Mughal emperor’s interest in questions of theology.
In September 1579, Akbar forwarded a letter to the
authorities at Goa requesting them to send two learned
priests. The Church authorities in Goa eagerly accepted the
invitation, seeing in it a chance to convert the emperor to
Christianity, and with him his court and the people. Jesuit
fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate were
selected for the purpose. When they reached Fatehpur Sikri
on February 28, 1580, they were received with honour.

30  

Aquaviva and Monserrate went back in 1583, belying the
hopes the Portuguese entertained of Akbar’s conversion to
the Christian faith. The second mission called by Akbar in
1590 also ended on a similar note in 1592. The third mission,
again invited by Akbar, arrived in 1595 at Lahore (where the
court was then residing) and continued as a sort of permanent
institution, thereby extending its influence on secular politics.
Fathers Jerome Xavier and Emanuel Pinheiro were the
leaders of the mission, and their letters from the court
became very widely known for the information they provided
on the later part of Akbar’s reign.
Prince Salim, on ascending the throne as Jahangir,
assuaged the Muslims by neglecting the Jesuit fathers.
Gradually, however, his temporary estrangement from the
Jesuits ended, and in 1606 he renewed his favours to
them. The elegant and spacious church at Lahore was allowed
to be retained by them along with the collegium or the
priests’ residence. In 1608, twenty baptisms were carried out
in Agra, the priests publicly acting with as much liberty as
in Portugal.
Jahangir’s conduct was such that the Jesuit priests
became hopeful of bringing him within the Christian fold.
However, these hopes were belied. Moreover, arrogant
actions on the part of the Portuguese viceroys created a rift
with the Mughal emperor.

Portuguese Lose Favour with
the Mughals

In 1608, Captain William Hawkins with his ship Hector
reached Surat. He brought with him a letter from James I,
King of England, to the Mughal court of Jahangir requesting
permission to do business in India. Father Pinheiro and the
Portuguese authorities did their best to prevent Hawkins from
reaching the Mughal court, but did not succeed. Jahangir
accepted the gifts Hawkins brought for him and gave Hawkins
a very favourable reception in 1609. As Hawkins knew the
Turki language well, he conversed with the emperor in that
language without the aid of an interpreter. Pleased with

Advent of the Europeans in India  31

Hawkins, Jahangir appointed him as a mansabdar of 400 at
a salary of Rs 30,000 (apparently, he never received it).
Hawkins was also married to the daughter of an Armenian
Christian named Mubarak Shah (Mubarikesha).
The grant of trading facilities to the English offended
the Portuguese. However, after negotiations, a truce was
established between the Portuguese and the Mughal emperor.
The Portuguese stopped the English ships from entering the
port of Surat. A baffled Hawkins left the Mughal court in
1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues or check
the vacillating Mughal policies. However, in November 1612,
the English ship Dragon under Captain Best along with a
little ship, the Osiander, successfully fought a Portuguese
fleet. Jahangir, who had no navy worth its name, learnt of
the English success and was greatly impressed.
The Portuguese acts of piracy also resulted in conflict
with the imperial Mughal government. In 1613, the Portuguese
offended Jahangir by capturing Mughal ships, imprisoning
many Muslims, and plundering the cargoes. An enraged
Jahangir ordered Muqarrab Khan, who was then in charge of
Surat, to obtain compensation. However, it was during the
reign of Shah Jahan, that the advantages which the Portuguese
enjoyed in the Mughal court were lost forever. Also lost were
the hopes of converting the royal family and Mughal India
to Christianity, a hope that the Portuguese held because of
the welcome accorded to them and their religion by Akbar
and Jahangir.
Capture of Hooghly
On the basis of an imperial farman circa 1579, the Portuguese
had settled down on a river bank which was a short distance
from Satgaon in Bengal to carry on their trading activities.
Over the years, they strengthened their position by constructing
big buildings which led to the migration of the trade from
Satgaon to the new port known as Hooghly. They monopolised
the manufacture of salt, built a custom house of their own
and started enforcing strictly the levy of duty on tobacco,
which had become an important article of trade since its
introduction at the beginning of the 17th century.

32  

The Portuguese not only made money as traders but
also started a cruel slave trade by purchasing or seizing Hindu
and Muslim children, whom they brought up as Christians.
In the course of their nefarious activities, they seized two
slave girls of Mumtaz Mahal. On June 24, 1632, the Mughal
siege of Hooghly began, ending in its capture three months
later. Shah Jahan ordered the Bengal governor Qasim Khan
to take action against the Portuguese. The siege of Hooghly
finally led to the Portuguese fleeing. The Mughals suffered
a loss of 1,000 men, but also took 400 prisoners to Agra.
The prisoners were offered the option to convert to Islam
or become slaves. The persecution of Christians continued
for some time after which it died down gradually.

Decline of the Portuguese

By the 18th century, the Portuguese in India lost their
commercial influence, though some of them still carried on
trade in their individual capacity and many took to piracy and
robbery. In fact, Hooghly was used by some Portuguese as
a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal. The decline of the
Portuguese was brought about by several factors. The local
advantages gained by the Portuguese in India were reduced
with the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia
and North India and the rise of the turbulent Marathas as their
immediate neighbours. (The Marathas captured Salsette and
Bassein in 1739 from the Portuguese.)
The religious policies of the Portuguese, such as the
activities of the Jesuits, gave rise to political fears. Their
antagonism for the Muslims apart, the Portuguese policy of
conversion to Christianity made Hindus also resentful.
Their dishonest trade practices also evoked a strong
reaction. The Portuguese earned notoriety as sea pirates.
Their arrogance and violence brought them the animosity of
the rulers of small states and the imperial Mughals as well.
The discovery of Brazil diverted colonising activities
of Portugal to the West.

The Portuguese entered India with the sword in one hand and

crucifix to fill their pockets, and not being able to hold them

with England and Holland, badly affected Portuguese monopoly
of trade in India.
The earlier monopoly of knowledge of the sea route
to India held by the Portuguese could not remain a secret
forever; soon enough the Dutch and the English, who were
learning the skills of ocean navigation, also learnt of it. As
new trading communities from Europe arrived in India, there
began a fierce rivalry among them. In this struggle, the
Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and
enterprising competitors. The Dutch and the English had
greater resources and more compulsions to expand overseas,
and they overcame the Portuguese resistance. One by one,

the Portuguese possessions fell to its opponents. Goa which
remained with the Portuguese had lost its importance as a
port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire and soon it did
not matter in whose possession it was. The spice trade came
under the control of the Dutch, and Goa was superseded by
Brazil as the economic centre of the overseas empire of
Portugal. In 1683, after two naval assaults, the Marathas
invaded Goa.

Significance of the Portuguese

Most historians have observed that the coming of the
Portuguese not only initiated what might be called the
European era, it marked the emergence of naval power. The
Cholas, among others, had been a naval power, but it was
now for the first time a foreign power had come to India
by way of the sea. The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and
this was the first step in gaining monopoly over trade—with
the threat or actual use of force. The Portuguese declared
their intention to abide by no rules except their own, and
they were intent on getting a decisive advantage over the
Indians and over the Indian Ocean trading system.
In the Malabar of the sixteenth century, the Portuguese
showed military innovation in their use of body armour,
matchlock men, and guns landed from the ships. The Portuguese
may have contributed by example to the Mughal use of field
guns, and the ‘artillery of the stirrup’. However, an important
military contribution made by the Portuguese onshore was
the system of drilling groups of infantry, on the Spanish
model, introduced in the 1630s as a counter to Dutch
pressure. The practice was adopted first by the French and
English, and later taken up by the Marathas and Sikhs, and
such armies of sepoys became new tools of empire in India.
The Portuguese were masters of improved techniques
at sea. Their multi-decked ships were heavily constructed,
designed as they were to ride out Atlantic gales rather than
run before the regular monsoons; this permitted them to carry
a heavier armament. Their use of castled prow and stern was
a noteworthy method by which to repel or launch boarding

Advent of the Europeans in India  35

parties. Indian builders adapted both to their own use.
However, the Portuguese skill at organisation—as in the
creation of royal arsenals and dockyards and the maintenance
of a regular system of pilots and mapping and pitting state
forces against private merchant shipping—was even more
noteworthy.The Mughals and Marathas may certainly have
learnt from the Portuguese but the more certain heirs of this
knowledge were other Europeans, especially the Dutch and
English, in Asia.
In India, the memory of religious persecution and
cruelty detracts from the other contributions made by the
Portuguese in the cultural field. However, it cannot be
forgotten that the missionaries and the Church were also
teachers and patrons in India of the arts of the painter, carver,
and sculptor. As in music, they were the interpreters, not just
of Portuguese, but of European art to India.
The art of the silversmith and goldsmith flourished at
Goa, and the place became a centre of elaborate filigree
work, fretted foliage work and metal work embedding jewels.
However, though the interior of churches built under the
Portuguese have plenty of woodwork and sculpture and
sometimes painted ceilings, they are generally simple in their
architectural plan.

The Dutch
Commercial enterprise led the Dutch to undertake voyages
to the East. Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutchman
to reach Sumatra and Bantam in 1596. In 1602, the StatesGeneral of the Netherlands amalgamated many trading
companies into the East India Company of the Netherlands.
This company was also empowered to carry on war, to
conclude treaties, to take possession of territory and to erect
fortresses.

Dutch Settlements

After their arrival in India, the Dutch founded their first
factory in Masulipatnam (in Andhra) in 1605. They went on
to establish trading centres in different parts of India and thus

36  

became a threat to the Portuguese. They captured Nagapatam
near Madras (Chennai) from the Portuguese and made it their
main stronghold in South India.
The Dutch established factories on the Coromandel
coast, in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Bihar. In 1609,
they opened a factory in Pulicat, north of Madras. Their other
principal factories in India were at Surat (1616), Bimlipatam
(1641), Karaikal (1645), Chinsura (1653), Baranagar,
Kasimbazar (near Murshidabad), Balasore, Patna, Nagapatam
(1658) and Cochin (1663). Participating in the redistributive
or carrying trade, they took to the islands of the Far East
various articles and merchandise from India. They carried
indigo manufactured in the Yamuna valley and Central India,
textiles and silk from Bengal, Gujarat and the Coromandel,
saltpetre from Bihar and opium and rice from the Ganga
valley.

Anglo-Dutch Rivalry

The English were also at this time rising to prominence in
the Eastern trade, and this posed a serious challenge to the
commercial interests of the Dutch. Commercial rivalry soon
turned into bloody warfare.
The climax of the enmity between the Dutch and the
English in the East was reached at Amboyna (a place in
present-day Indonesia, which the Dutch had captured from
the Portuguese in 1605) where they massacred ten Englishmen
and nine Japanese in 1623.
This incident further intensified the rivalry between the
two European companies. After prolonged warfare, both the
parties came to a compromise in 1667 by which the British
agreed to withdraw all their claims on Indonesia, and the
Dutch retired from India to concentrate on their more
profitable trade in Indonesia. They monopolised the trade in
black pepper and spices. The most important Indian
commodities the Dutch traded in were silk, cotton, indigo,
rice and opium.

Decline of the Dutch in India

The Dutch got drawn into the trade of the Malay Archipelago.
Further, in the third Anglo-Dutch War (1672-74),

Advent of the Europeans in India  37
View
The Dutch rivalry with the English, during the seventeenth
century, was more bitter than that of the Portuguese. The policy
of the Dutch in the East was influenced by two motives: one
was to take revenge on Catholic Spain, the foe of their
independence, and her ally Portugal, and the other was to
colonise and establish settlements in the East Indies with a view
to monopolising commerce in that region. They gained their first
object by the gradual decline of Portuguese influence. The
realisation of their second object brought them into bitter
competition with the English.

in An Advanced History of India

communications between Surat and the new English settlement
of Bombay got cut due to which three homebound English
ships were captured in the Bay of Bengal by the Dutch forces.
The retaliation by the English resulted in the defeat of the
Dutch, in the battle of Hooghly (November 1759), which
dealt a crushing blow to Dutch ambitions in India.
The Dutch were not much interested in empire building
in India; their concerns were trade. In any case, their main
commercial interest lay in the Spice Islands of Indonesia
from where they earned a huge profit through business.

The English
Charter of Queen Elizabeth I

Francis Drake’s voyage around the world in 1580 and the
English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 generated
a new sense of enterprise in the British, encouraging sailors
to venture out to the East. As the knowledge grew of the
high profits earned by the Portuguese in Eastern trade,
English traders too wanted a share. So in 1599, a group of
English merchants calling themselves the ‘Merchant
Adventurers’ formed a company. On December 31, 1600,
Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter with rights of exclusive
trading to the company named the ‘Governor and Company
of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies’.
Initially, a monopoly of fifteen years was granted, which in

38  

May 1609 was extended indefinitely by a fresh charter. As
the Dutch were already concentrating more on the East
Indies, the English turned to India in search of textiles and
other commodities of trade.

Progress of the English Company
Foothold in West and South
Captain Hawkins arrived in the court of Jahangir in April
1609 itself. But the mission to establish a factory at Surat
didn’t succeed due to opposition from the Portuguese, and
Hawkins left Agra in November 1611. In 1611, the English
had started trading at Masulipatnam on the south-eastern
coast of India and later established a factory there in 1616.
It was in 1612 that Captain Thomas Best defeated the
Portuguese in the sea off Surat; an impressed Jahangir granted
permission to the English in early 1613 to establish a factory
at Surat under Thomas Aldworth. In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe
came as an accredited ambassador of James I to the court
of Jahangir, staying on there till February 1619. Though he
was unsuccessful in concluding a commercial treaty with the
Mughal emperor, he was able to secure a number of
privileges, including permission to set up factories at Agra,
Ahmedabad and Broach.
The English company did not have a smooth progress.
It had to contend with the Portuguese and the Dutch in the
beginning. But the changing situation helped them and turned
things in their favour. Bombay had been gifted to King
Charles II by the King of Portugal as dowry when Charles
married the Portuguese princess Catherine in 1662. Bombay
was given over to the East India Company on an annual
payment of ten pounds only in 1668. Later Bombay was made
the headquarters by shifting the seat of the Western Presidency
from Surat to Bombay in 1687. So there was tacit peace
between the English and the Portuguese now. There was also
an Anglo-Dutch compromise as mentioned earlier by which
the Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English company’s
trade in India. Thus the English were rid of two arch-rivals
in India.

Advent of the Europeans in India  39

The English company’s position was improved by the
‘Golden Farman’ issued to them by the Sultan of Golconda
in 1632. On a payment of 500 pagodas a year, they earned
the privilege of trading freely in the ports of Golconda. A
member of the Masulipatnam council, the British merchant
Francis Day in 1639 received from the ruler of Chandragiri
permission to build a fortified factory at Madras which later
became the Fort St. George and replaced Masulipatnam as
the headquarters of the English settlements in south India.
Thereafter, the English extended their trading activities to the
east and started factories at Hariharpur in the Mahanadi delta
and at Balasore (in Odisha) in 1633.
Foothold in Bengal
Bengal was then a large and rich province in India, advanced
in trade and commerce. Commercial and political control
over Bengal naturally appeared an attractive proposition to
the profit-seeking English merchants. Bengal was also an
important province of the Mughal empire.
Shah Shuja, the subahdar (or governor) of Bengal in
1651, allowed the English to trade in Bengal in return for
an annual payment of Rs 3,000, in lieu of all duties. Factories
in Bengal were started at Hooghly (1651) and other places
like Kasimbazar, Patna and Rajmahal. Nevertheless, despite
the privileges of the farmans, the Company’s business was
now and then obstructed by customs officers in the local
checkposts who asked for payment of tolls. In pursuance
of its changed policy, the Company wanted to have a fortified
settlement at Hooghly so that force could be used if
necessary. William Hedges, the first agent and governor of
the Company in Bengal, appealed to Shaista Khan, the Mughal
governor of Bengal in August 1682, for redressal of the
grievance. As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities
broke out between the English and the Mughals. Four years
later, Hooghly was sacked by the imperial Mughals in
October 1686. The English retaliated by capturing the
imperial forts at Thana (modern Garden Reach), raiding Hijli
in east Midnapur and storming the Mughal fortifications at

40  

Balasore. However, the English were forced to leave Hooghly
and were sent to an unhealthy location at the mouth of the
River Ganga.
After the Mughal raid on Hooghly, Job Charnock, a
company agent, started negotiations with the Mughals so as
to return to a place called Sutanuti. Charnock signed a treaty
with the Mughals in February 1690, and returned to Sutanuti
in August 1690. Thus, an English factory was established on
February 10, 1691, the day an imperial farman was issued
permitting the English to “continue contentedly their trade
in Bengal” on payment of Rs 3,000 a year in lieu of all dues.
A zamindar in Bardhaman district, Sobha Singh, rebelled,
subsequently giving the English the pretext they were looking
for, to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696. In 1698,
the English succeeded in getting the permission to buy the
zamindari of the three villages of Sutanuti, Gobindapur and
Kalikata (Kalighat) from their owners on payment of Rs
1,200. The fortified settlement was named Fort William in
the year 1700 when it also became the seat of the eastern
presidency (Calcutta) with Sir Charles Eyre as its first
president.
Farrukhsiyar’s Farmans
In 1715, an English mission led by John Surman to the court
of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar secured three famous
farmans, giving the Company many valuable privileges in
Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad. The farmans thus obtained
were regarded the Magna Carta of the Company. Their
important terms were—
●
In Bengal, the Company’s imports and exports were
exempted from additional customs duties excepting
the annual payment of 3,000 rupees as settled
earlier.
●
The Company was permitted to issue dastaks (passes)
for the transportation of such goods.
●
The Company was permitted to rent more lands
around Calcutta.
●
In Hyderabad, the Company retained its existing

Advent of the Europeans in India  41

privilege of freedom from duties in trade and had
to pay the prevailing rent only for Madras.
●
In Surat, for an annual payment of 10,000 rupees,
the East India Company was exempted from the levy
of all duties.
●
It was decreed that the coins of the Company minted
at Bombay were to have currency throughout the
Mughal empire.
Apparently, the English East India Company managed
to earn a number of trading concessions in Bengal from the
Mughal authority by means of flattery and diplomacy.
But the English had to vanquish the French before they

could be rid of competitors and establish their complete sway
over India.
Merging of Two English Companies
After the English revolution of 1688, the Whigs, with their
enhanced influence, opposed the monopoly of the East India
Company. Thus a rival company was formed which deputed
Sir William Norris as its ambassador to the court of
Aurangzeb (January 1701-April 1702) to gain trading privileges
for itself. The new company, however, proved a failure. Under
pressure from the Crown and the Parliament, the two
companies were amalgamated in 1708 under the title of
‘United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the
East Indies’. This was the East India Company—from 1708
to 1873—which was to establish British political power in
India.

The French
Foundation of French Centres in India

Although the French harboured a wish to engage in the
commerce of the East since the opening years of the
sixteenth century, their appearance on the Indian coasts was
late. Indeed, the French were the last Europeans to come to
India with the purpose of trade. During the reign of Louis
XIV, the king’s famous minister Colbert laid the foundation
of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales (French East India
Company) in 1664, in which the king also took a deep
interest. The Compagnie des Indes Orientales was granted
a 50-year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific
Oceans. The French king also granted the company a concession
in perpetuity for the island of Madagascar, as well as any
other territories it could conquer. The Company spent a lot
of its money and resources in trying to revive the colonies
of Madagascar but without any success. Then in 1667,
Francois Caron headed an expedition to India, setting up a
factory in Surat. Mercara, a Persian who accompanied Caron,
founded another French factory in Masulipatnam in 1669
after obtaining a patent from the Sultan of Golconda. In 1673,

Advent of the Europeans in India  43

the French obtained permission from Shaista Khan, the
Mughal subahdar of Bengal, to establish a township at
Chandernagore near Calcutta.
Pondicherry—Nerve Centre of French
Power in India
In 1673, Sher Khan Lodi, the governor of Valikondapuram
(under the Bijapur Sultan), granted Francois Martin, the
director of the Masulipatnam factory, a site for a settlement.
Pondicherry was founded in 1674. In the same year, Francois
Martin replaced Caron as the French governor.
The French company established its factories in other
parts of India also, particularly in the coastal regions. Mahe,
Karaikal, Balasore and Qasim Bazar were a few important
trading centres of the French East India Company.
After taking charge of Pondicherry in 1674, Francois
Martin developed it as a place of importance. It was indeed,
the stronghold of the French in India.
Early Setbacks to the French East India Company
The French position in India was badly affected with the
outbreak of war between the Dutch and the French. Bolstered
by their alliance with the English since the Revolution of
1688, the Dutch captured Pondicherry in 1693. Although the
Treaty of Ryswick concluded in September 1697 restored
Pondicherry to the French, the Dutch garrison held on to it
for two more years. Once again, under Francois Martin’s able
guidance Pondicherry flourished and turned out to be the
most important settlement of the French in India. Again there
was a bad turn in the fortunes of the French company in India
when the War of Spanish Succession broke out in Europe.
Consequent to this, they had to abandon their factories at
Surat, Masulipatnam and Bantam in the early 18th century.
The French in India had another setback when Francois Martin
died on December 31, 1706.
Reorganisation of the French Company
In 1720, the French company was reorganised as the ‘Perpetual
Company of the Indies’ which revived its strength. This was

44  

further enhanced by the stewardship of two active and wise
governors, Lenoir and Dumas, between 1720 and 1742.
Further, the French India was backed by the French possession
of Mauritius and Reunion in the southern Indian Ocean.

The Anglo-French Struggle for Supremacy:
the Carnatic Wars
Background of Rivalry
Though the British and the French came to India for trading
purposes, they were ultimately drawn into the politics of
India. Both had visions of establishing political power over
the region. The Anglo-French rivalry in India reflected the
traditional rivalry of England and France throughout their
histories; it began with the outbreak of the Austrian War of
Succession and ended with the conclusion of the Seven
Years’ War. Specifically in India, the rivalry, in the form of
three Carnatic wars, decided once for all that the English and
not the French were to become masters of India.
In 1740, the political situation in south India was
uncertain and confused. Nizam Asaf Jah of Hyderabad was
old and fully engaged in battling the Marathas in the western
Deccan while his subordinates were speculating upon the
consequences of his death. To the south of his kingdom lay
the Coromandel coast without any strong ruler to maintain
a balance of power. Instead, there was the remnant of the
old Vijayanagara empire in interior Mysore, Cochin and
Travancore on the Malabar coast, and in the east the small
states of Madura (Madurai), Tanjore (Thanjavur) and
Trichinopoly (Thiruchirapally). The decline of Hyderabad was
the signal for the end of Muslim expansionism and the
English adventurers got their plans ready. Also, there was the
Maratha kingdom of Tanjore, providing the Peshwa of Pune
an excuse for interference whenever he pleased.
First Carnatic War (1740-48)
Background Carnatic was the name given by the
Europeans to the Coromandel coast and its hinterland. The
First Carnatic War was an extension of the Anglo-French War

Advent of the Europeans in India  45

in Europe which was caused by the Austrian War of
Succession.
Immediate Cause Although France, conscious of its
relatively weaker position in India, did not favour an extension
of hostilities to India, the English navy under Barnet seized
some French ships to provoke France. France retaliated by
seizing Madras in 1746 with the help of the fleet from
Mauritius, the Isle of France, under Admiral La Bourdonnais,
the French governor of Mauritius. Thus began the first
Carnatic War.
Result The First Carnatic War ended in 1748 when the
Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle was signed bringing the Austrian
War of Succession to a conclusion. Under the terms of this
treaty, Madras was handed back to the English, and the
French, in turn, got their territories in North America.
Significance The First Carnatic War is remembered
for the Battle of St. Thome (in Madras) fought between the
French forces and the forces of Anwar-ud-din, the Nawab of
Carnatic, to whom the English appealed for help. A small
French army under Captain Paradise defeated the strong
Indian army under Mahfuz Khan at St. Thome on the banks
of the River Adyar. This was an eye-opener for the Europeans
in India: it revealed that even a small disciplined army could
easily defeat a much larger Indian army. Further, this war
adequately brought out the importance of naval force in the
Anglo-French conflict in the Deccan.
Second Carnatic War (1749-54)
Background The background for the Second Carnatic
War was provided by rivalry in India. Dupleix, the French
governor who had successfully led the French forces in the
First Carnatic War, sought to increase his power and French
political influence in southern India by interfering in local
dynastic disputes to defeat the English.
Immediate Cause The opportunity was provided by the
death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, the founder of the independent
kingdom of Hyderabad, in 1748, and the release of Chanda
Sahib, the son-in-law of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic,

46  

by the Marathas in the same year. The accession of Nasir
Jang, the son of the Nizam, to the throne of Hyderabad was
opposed by Muzaffar Jang, the grandson of the Nawab, who
laid claim to the throne saying that the Mughal Emperor had
appointed him as the governor of the Carnatic. In the Carnatic,
the appointment of Anwar-ud-din Khan as the Nawab was
resented by Chanda Sahib.
The French supported the claims of Muzaffar Jang and
Chanda Sahib in the Deccan and Carnatic, respectively, while
the English sided with Nasir Jang and Anwar-ud-din.
Course of the War The combined armies of Muzaffar
Jang, Chanda Sahib and the French defeated and killed Anwarud-din at the Battle of Ambur (near Vellore) in 1749.
Muzaffar Jang became the subahdar of Deccan, and Dupleix
was appointed governor of all the Mughal territories to the
south of the River Krishna. A French army under Bussy was
stationed at Hyderabad to secure French interests there.
Territories near Pondicherry and also some areas on the
Orissa coast (including Masulipatnam) were ceded to the
French.
Having failed to provide effective assistance to
Muhammad Ali at Trichinopoly, Robert Clive, then an agent
(‘factor’) of the English company, put forward the proposal
for a diversionary attack on the governor of Madras, Saunders.
He suggested a sudden raid on Arcot, the capital of the
Carnatic, so as to relieve the pressure on Trichinopoly. He
reasoned that in such an event Chanda Sahib would rush to
save his capital. Thus, in August 1751, with only a force of
210 men Robert Clive attacked and captured Arcot. As
expected, Chanda Sahib hastened to his capital, taking a force
of 4,000 men from Trichinopoly, but failed to get back the
fort even after a siege of 53 days, from September 23 to
November 14. Now Mysore, Tanjore and the Maratha chief,
Morari Rao, came to the aid of Trichinopoly, and of Clive
and Stringer Lawrence. Trichinopoly was first relieved of its
siege, while General Law of France with Chanda Sahib
remained cooped up in the island of Srirangam. They were
forced to surrender in June 1752 when Muhammad Ali
executed Chanda Sahib, the British failing to interfere.

Advent of the Europeans in India  47

Rise and Fall of Dupleix in India
Joseph Francis Dupleix, born in 1697, was the son of a wealthy
Farmer-General of Taxes and Director-General of the Company of
the Indies. He got a high post at Pondicherry in 1720, allegedly
on the basis of influence of his father. At Pondicherry he made
a lot of money by private trade, which was then permitted to
servants of the French company. In December 1726, he was
suspended owing to drastic change in the constitution of the French
company and some confusions arising out of that. In 1730, Dupleix
won his case, and was appointed as governor of Chandernagore
as compensation. In 1741, he was appointed as the Director-General
of French colonies in India. Later, he was conferred the title of
Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan,
Muzzaffar Jang.
According to historians, Dupleix possessed qualities of an
administrator, a diplomat, and a leader besides having political
insight with a broad vision.
Dupleix in the Role of Administrator
In 1741, Dupleix became the Governor-General of Pondicherry.
He found Pondicherry facing several problems—Maratha invasion,
famine, uncultivated land and chaotic conditions in the Carnatic.
Apart from these, the Directors of the Company sought a drastic
cut in expenditure of the French East India Company, owing to
the priority given to the French colonies in North America. So,
Dupleix reduced public expenditure, despite opposition from his
council, and balanced income and expenditure, coupled with a cut
on salaries of officers. However, he decided to disobey the directors
on the matter of fortification of settlements. He enhanced the
defences of Pondicherry, even spending a large sum from his
personal wealth. He made Pondicherry the emporium of commerce
in south India by taking practical steps to develop the trade of
the colony. Later, the Directors of the Company praised Dupleix
for taking the right decisions, even in contradiction of the directors.
Dupleix as a Master of Diplomacy
The analysis of the first two Carnatic wars proves the
diplomacy of Dupleix as a leader who visualised the path of the
European conquest of India.
Dupleix used the Nawab of Carnatic to forbid the English from
waging war in his territories so that the French settlements at
Pondicherry could be protected till the French forces acquired
enough strength. In return the nawab was promised Madras after
the English got defeated. But Dupleix, using his diplomacy, didn’t

48  
give Madras to the nawab and even defeated him at St. Thome
(1746).
Dupleix convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises
made to the English, citing examples from history that promises
made under certain circumstances were never binding. Further, he
said that since the position of the governor-general was superior
to that of the commander of navy, the compact entered into between
the latter and the English was ultra vires. Thus, he was able to
convince his subordinate to do what was considered unethical in
general terms, but best suited for one’s nation.
Dupleix was the first European to interfere in the internal
politics of the Indian rulers. He supported Muzzaffar Jang for
Hyderabad and Chanda Sahib for Carnatic and his candidates
emerged successful and, in return, gave great concessions to
Dupleix.
Dupleix was, in fact, the originator of the practice of subsidiary
alliance in India. He placed a French army at Hyderabad at the
expense of the subahdar.
Why Dupleix Failed in India
Dupleix was recalled in 1754 due to the initial defeat of the
French army in the Second Carnatic War and the heavy cost
incurred by the company due to Dupleix’s political decisions. Many
historians have called the recall of Dupleix by the directors as a
blunder—a result of a compromise between France and England
over issues in America. However, there were some weaknesses
in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows:
(i) Dupleix suffered from an over-sanguine temperament. He
hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical
situations.
(ii) The peers of Dupleix didn’t like his autocratic behaviour
and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter.
(iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign,
directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield
like Lawrence or Clive. The French failed to capture Trichinopoly
(1752-53) because the schemes thought out by Dupleix could not
be turned into action by his commanders.

Result The French authorities, annoyed at the heavy
financial losses that Dupleix’s policy involved, decided to
recall him in 1754. Godeheu succeeded Dupleix as the
French governor-general in India. Godeheu adopted a policy
of negotiations with the English and concluded a treaty with
them. The English and the French agreed not to interfere in

The struggle between Dupleix and Clive in India, the defence
of Arcot and the deeds which led to the founding of our Indian
Empire… all these events were part of a desperate struggle for
supremacy between England and France.
—J.R. Seeley
We may regard Dupleix as the most striking figure in the short
Indian episode of that long and arduous contest for transmarine
dominion which was fought out between France and England in
the eighteenth century, although it was far beyond his power
to influence the ultimate destiny of either nation in India, and
although the result of his plans was that ‘we accomplished for
ourselves against the French exactly everything that the French
intended to accomplish for themselves against us’ (Clive). It is
certain, moreover, that the conception of an Indian Empire had
already been formed by others besides Dupleix, and that more
than one clearheaded observer had perceived how easily the
whole country might be subdued by an European power.

the quarrels of native princes. Also, each party was left in
possession of the territories actually occupied by them at
the time of the treaty. According to historians, the fear of
serious repercussions in America prompted the French to
suspend hostilities in India.
Implications It became evident that the countenance
of Indian authority was no longer necessary for European
success; rather Indian authority itself was becoming dependent
on European support. Muhammad Ali in the Carnatic and
Salabat Jang in Hyderabad became clients rather than patrons.
Third Carnatic War (1758-63)
Background In Europe, when Austria wanted to recover
Silesia in 1756, the Seven Years War (1756-63) started.
Britain and France were once again on opposite sides.
Course of War in India In 1758, the French army
under Count de Lally captured the English forts of St. David
and Vizianagaram. Now, the English became offensive and
inflicted heavy losses on the French fleet under Admiral
D’Ache at Masulipatnam.

50  

Battle of Wandiwash The decisive battle of the Third
Carnatic War was won by the English on January 22, 1760
at Wandiwash (or Vandavasi) in Tamil Nadu. General Eyre
Coote of the English totally routed the French army under
Count Thomas Arthur de Lally and took Bussy as prisoner.
Pondicherry was gallantly defended by Lally for eight
months before he surrendered on January 16, 1761. With the
loss of Jinji and Mahe, the French power in India was reduced
to its lowest. Lally, after being taken as prisoner of war at
London, returned to France where he was imprisoned and
executed in 1766.
Result and Significance The Third Carnatic War
proved decisive. Although the Treaty of Peace of Paris
(1763) restored to the French their factories in India, the
French political influence disappeared after the war. Thereafter,
the French, like their Portuguese and Dutch counterparts in
India, confined themselves to their small enclaves and to
commerce. The English became the supreme European power
in the Indian subcontinent, since the Dutch had already been
defeated in the Battle of Bidara in 1759.
The Battle of Plassey, in 1757, is usually regarded by
historians as the decisive event that brought about ultimate
British rule over India. However, one cannot quite ignore the
view that the true turning point for control of the subcontinent
was the victory of British forces over the French forces at
Wandiwash in 1760. The victory at Wandiwash left the
English East India Company with no European rival in India.
View
While the English received supplies of food and money from
Bengal, recruits of men from Europe, and grain from their northern
settlements, the French could receive nothing but what came
to them laboriously by land. The first were constantly strengthened,
the second was constantly weakened. And this enabled Coote
to establish his military superiority over Lally in the field and
to hem him within the walls of Pondicherry.
—H.H. Dodwell
(The Cambridge History of India, Vol V)

Advent of the Europeans in India  51

Thus they were ready to take over the rule of the entire
country.
Significantly, in the Battle of Wandiwash, natives
served in both the armies as sepoys. It makes one think:
irrespective of which side won, there was an inevitability
about the fall of India to European invaders. There was a lack
of sensitivity to geopolitics of the day as well as a lack of
foresight on the part of native rulers.

Causes for the English Success and the
French Failure

The English company was a private enterprise—this created
a sense of enthusiasm and self-confidence among the people.
With less governmental control over it, this company could
take instant decisions when needed without waiting for the
approval of the government. The French company, on the
other hand, was a State concern. It was controlled and
regulated by the French government and was hemmed in by
government policies and delays in decision-making.
The English navy was superior to the French navy; it
helped to cut off the vital sea link between the French
possessions in India and France.
The English held three important places, namely,
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras whereas the French had only
Pondicherry.
The French subordinated their commercial interest to
territorial ambition, which made the French company short
of funds.
In spite of their imperialistic motives, the British never
neglected their commercial interests. So they always had the
funds and the consequent sound financial condition to help
them significantly in the wars against their rivals.
A major factor in the success of the English in India
was the superiority of the commanders in the British camp.
In comparison to the long list of leaders on the English side
—Sir
Eyre Coote, Major Stringer Lawrence, Robert
Clive and many others—there was only Dupleix on the French
side.

52  

About the Goods in Trade Initially
There are accounts by various European travellers and traders about
the activities in port towns such as Surat which give details of
the intricate steps that went into the creation of fabrics collectively
called ‘Indian’.
Great demand was there for cotton longcloth, (usually 35 to
50 m in length), salempores (staple cotton cloth), and morees
(superior quality cotton cloth). Other much desired fabrics were the
painted cloths and prints, the silks and dyes. These textiles were
not just in demand in Europe but also in other parts of Asia. Indians
had traded in textiles for centuries before the Europeans arrived.
In China, Japan and the Indonesian archipelago, Indian cotton was
popular for its lightweight, yet strong qualities. When the Dutch,
English and French acquired materials from India, it was not only
for their home countries, but for transport to Malacca or Java, for
example, where they were traded for spices. By the 18th century,
the French had coloured patterned handkerchiefs specially woven
for particular island markets - which proved a successful entrepreneurial
effort.
A corollary to the trade in textiles and spices was the trade
in slaves. It is generally considered that slave trade concerned
Europe, Africa, and the Americas (the ‘New World’), but this ignores
the fact that trade between Europe and Asia also helped to sustain
slavery. French ships took European goods to Asia, where they
acquired cowry shells and Indian textiles that were highly valued
in West Africa. Traders exchanged these goods in Africa for slaves,
who were sent to the colonies of France in the Americas. “The
circle was completed,” says the Yale Center for the Study of
Globalisation, “when sugar and other goods from the Americas were
loaded on board and shipped back to France.”
When the French East India Company started trading in India,
they entered an already well established, complex economic system,
an intricate network of production, negotiation, delivery, and distribution.
Large commercial fleets as well as prosperous shore-based businesses
were run by Indian merchants. Weavers and merchants worked with
overland freight operators and brokers, who worked with exporters
and ship owners. These agents had also to negotiate with local
state officials for commercial privileges. The European traders had
to learn well established rules and practices and successfully
collaborate with indigenous envoys.
The factories of all the European trading groups were to be
found in practically the same places. At the peak of the Indian
trade, the demand for Indian goods exceeded the supply by weavers
and other artisans; even so there was no serious rivalry initially.

Advent of the Europeans in India  53
But as the three companies—the Dutch, the English and the
French—grew more competitive, the English, better funded and
better conversant in local business practices and customs, were
able to expand their factory outposts to larger industrial towns under
their jurisdiction. Gradually, these commercial strongholds turned
into political enclaves, ultimately enabling the English to expand
and consolidate their power and control all over India.

The Danes
The Danish East India Company was established in 1616 and,
in 1620, they founded a factory at Tranquebar near Tanjore,
on the eastern coast of India. Their principal settlement was
at Serampore near Calcutta. The Danish factories, which were
not important at any time, were sold to the British government
in 1845. The Danes are better known for their missionary
activities than for commerce.

Why the English Succeeded
against Other European
Powers
Of all the European nations who came as traders to India
after new sea routes were discovered, England emerged as
the most powerful and successful by the end of the eighteenth
century. The major factors which can be attributed for the
success of the English against other European powers—
Portugal, the Netherlands, France and Denmark—in the world
in general and in India in particular were as follows.

Structure and Nature of the Trading
Companies

The English East India Company, formed through amalgamation
of several rival companies at home, was controlled by a board
of directors whose members were elected annually. The
shareholders of the company exercised considerable influence,
as the votes could be bought and sold through purchase of
shares. The trading companies of France and Portugal were
largely owned by the State and their nature was in many ways
feudalistic.

54  

In the French company, the monarch had more than 60
per cent share and, its directors were nominated by the
monarch from the shareholders who were supposed to carry
out the decisions of two high commissioners appointed by
the government. The shareholders took very little interest in
promoting the prosperity of the company, because the State
guaranteed a dividend to the shareholders. The lack of public
interest could be inferred from the fact that between 1725
and 1765, there was no meeting of the shareholders and the
company was simply managed as a department of the State.

Naval Superiority

The Royal Navy of Britain was not only the largest; it was
the most advanced of its times. The victory against the
Spanish Armada and against the French at Trafalgar had put
the Royal Navy at the peak of the European naval forces.
In India too, the British were able to defeat the Portuguese
and the French due to strong and fast movement of the naval
ships. The English learnt from the Portuguese the importance
of an efficient navy and improved their own fleet
technologically.

Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution started in England in the early 18th
century, with the invention of new machines like the spinning
Jenny, steam engine, the power loom and several others.
These machines greatly improved production in the fields of
textiles, metallurgy, steam power and agriculture. The industrial
revolution reached other European nations late and this
helped England to maintain its hegemony.

Military Skill and Discipline

The British soldiers were a disciplined lot and well trained.
The British commanders were strategists who tried new
tactics in warfare. Technological developments equipped the
military well. All this combined to enable smaller groups of
English fighters defeat larger armies.

Stable Government

With the exception of the Glorious Revolution of 1688,
Britain witnessed stable government with efficient monarchs.

Advent of the Europeans in India  55

Other European nations like France witnessed violent
revolution in 1789 and afterwards the Napoleonic Wars.
Napoleon’s defeat in 1815, significantly weakened France’s
position and from then on it was forced to side with Britain.
The Italians got united as a nation as late in 1861. The Dutch
and Spain were also involved in the 80-years war in the 17th
century which weakened Portuguese imperialism. The Dutch
East India Company, affected by bankruptcy in 1800 coupled
with the revolution in 1830, was forced to sell its possessions
to Britain and quit Asia.

Lesser Zeal for Religion

Britain was less zealous about religion and less interested
in spreading Christianity, as compared to Spain, Portugal or
the Dutch. Thus, its rule was far more acceptable to the
subjects than that of other colonial powers.

Use of Debt Market

One of the major and innovative reasons why Britain succeeded
between the mid-eighteenth century and the mid-nineteenth
century, while other European nations fell, was that it used
the debt markets to fund its wars. The world’s first central
bank—the Bank of England—was established to sell
government debt to the money markets on the promise of
a decent return on Britain’s defeating rival countries like
France and Spain. Britain was thus enabled to spend much
more on its military than its rivals. Britain’s rival France
could not match the expenditure of the English; between
1694 and 1812, first under the monarchs, then under the
revolutionary governments and finally under Napoleon
Bonaparte, France simply went bankrupt with its outdated
ways of raising money.
Summary
Why a Sea Route to India
(i) Spirit of renaissance in the 15th-century Europe.
(ii) European economy growing rapidly, leading to prosperity and
demand for luxury goods; increase in the supply of meat
requiring spices for preservation.

56  
(iii) Capture of Constantinople in 1453, and Syria and Egypt later
by the Ottoman Turks calling for a new route to reach India
without dealing with Arabs and Turks.
(iv) Venice and Genoa too small to stand up to the Turks.
(v) Spain and Portugal aided with money and men by the North
Europeans and by ships and technical knowledge by the
Genoese.
(vi) The Portuguese the pioneers followed by the Dutch, English,
Danes and the French respectively to reach India.
The Portuguese
Vasco Da Gama discovered sea route to India in 1498.
Vasco’s second visit in 1502 led to the establishment of trading
stations at Calicut, Cochin and Cannanore.
Francisco de Almeida (1505-09) First governor, initiated the blue
water policy (cartaze system).
Alfonso de Albuquerque (1509-1515) Considered to be the
founder of the Portuguese power in India: captured Goa from
Bijapur; persecuted Muslims; captured Bhatkal from Sri
Krishna Deva Rai (1510) of Vijayanagara; and initiated the
policy of marrying with the natives of India and banned the
practice of sati in his area of influence.
Nino da Cunha (1529-38) shifted the capital from Cochin to Goa
in 1530. In his rule, Diu and Bassein came under the
Portuguese occupation from Gujarat King Bahadur Shah.
Bahadur Shah got killed in 1537 at Diu while negotiating
with the Portuguese.
Factors for Decline of the Portuguese in India (a) Emergence
of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia and north India and
the appearance of the Marathas as neighbours; (b) political
fears aroused by the activities of Jesuit missionaries, and
hatred of persecution (such as inquisition) that caused
reaction against Portuguese spiritual pressure; (c) rise of
the English and Dutch commercial ambitions challenging the
Portuguese supremacy; (d) rampant corruption, greed and
selfishness along with piracy and clandestine trade practices
of the Portuguese administration in India; (e) diversion of
Portuguese colonising ambitions towards the West due to
the discovery of Brazil.
The Dutch
(i) The United East India Company of the Netherlands
(Verehgidge Oost Indische Compagnie), formed in March

Advent of the Europeans in India  57
1602 by the Charter of Dutch Parliament, had the powers
to wage wars, make treaty and build forts.
(ii) Dutch Factories in India Masulipatnam (1605), Pulicat

Chinsurah (1653), Cassimbazar (Kasimbazar), Baranagore,
Patna, Balasore, Nagapatam (1658) and Cochin (1663).
(iii) Decline in India The defeat of the Dutch in the Anglo-Dutch
rivalry and the shifting of Dutch attention towards the Malay
Archipelago.
(iv) Battle of Bidara (1759) The English defeated the Dutch.
The English
Factors for Foundation Drake’s voyage round the world, and
English victory over the mighty Spanish Armada leading to
great ambitions.
Formation English East India Company was formed on
December 31, 1600 by the charter issued by Queen Elizabeth
I, which gave the company monopoly to trade in the East
Indies for 15 years.
Settlements in India (i) With Captain Thomas Best’s victory over
the Portuguese (1612), the English established their first
factory at Surat (1613). Subsequently Sir Thomas Roe secured
permission from Jehangir to establish factories at Agra,
Ahmedabad and Broach.
(ii) Bombay came under the control of the Company, with Charles
II (who received it as a part of the Portuguese dowry) leasing
it out to the English Company for an annual rent of 10 pounds.
(iii) Madras with the Fort St. George replaced Masulipatnam as
the English headquarters on the east coast, when the former
was given by the Chandragiri chief to the English in 1639.
(iv) The city of Calcutta grew from the development of three
villages Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata secured from the
Mughal governor of Bengal. The fortified settlement was
named Fort William (1700) and it became the seat of British
power in India till 1911.
Farrukhsiyar’s Farmans In 1717, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar’s
farmans, called Magna Carta of the East India Company, gave
significant privileges to the Company in Bengal, Gujarat and
Hyderabad.
Merger of Companies In 1635, a rival company named Courteen

58  
Association later called the Assada company, formed by Sir
William Courteen, was given license to trade by Charles I.
In 1657, both the companies merged.
In 1698, another rival company emerged. In 1702, the rivalry
between the old and the new company came to an end, but
their final amalgamation took place in 1708 under the title
‘The United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the
East Indies, after the arbitration of the Earl of Godolphin. This
Company ruled in India till 1858.
The French
Foundation In 1664, Colbert, a minister of Louis XIV, laid the
foundations of Compagnie des Indes Orientales.
Settlements in India Pondicherry, developed as headquarters, was
granted to Francois Martin, the director of Masulipatnam
factory, by Valikondapuram governor Sher Khan Lodi in 1673.
Finally incorporated into Indian Union in 1954.
Anglo-French Rivalry in India The Anglo-French rivalry in India
coincided with the wars between the English and French in
Europe.
Causes ● For protection and expansion of commercial interests.
● Political developments in the south India and Europe
provided pretexts to contest their claims which culminated
in three Carnatic wars.
First Carnatic War (1740-48) It was an extension of the AngloFrench rivalry in Europe and ended in 1748 with the Treaty
of Aix-La Chapelle.
Second Carnatic War (1749-54) Although inconclusive, it
undermined the French power in South India vis-à-vis the
English.
Third Carnatic War (1758-63) ● A decisive war, known for
the Battle of Wandiwash (1760-61);
● An echo of the Anglo-French struggle in Europe.
● By the Treaty of Paris (1763), the French were allowed
to use Indian settlements for commercial purposes only
and fortification of settlements were banned.
Causes of the French Failure ● Inadequate Military and Financial
Support
● France’s Involvement in Europe
● Ill-managed Policy of Imperial France
● Lack of Commercial Incentive to the French Company
● Sound Commercial Base of the English Company

Chapter 4

India on the Eve of
British Conquest
The first half of the eighteenth century saw the decline of
the mighty Mughals, who had been the envy of their
contemporaries for almost two centuries. The reign of
Aurangzeb (1658-1707) proved to signify the beginning of
the end of Mughal rule in India. It is argued that Aurangzeb’s
misguided policies weakened the stability of the state and
the decline gained momentum after his death due to wars
of succession and weak rulers. Though Muhammad Shah ruled
for a long spell of 29 years (1719-48), a revival of the
imperial fortunes did not take place as he was an incompetent
ruler. Muhammad Shah’s reign witnessed the establishment
of the independent states of Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh and
Punjab. Several local chiefs began to assert their independence
and the Marathas began to make their bid to inherit the
imperial mantle.

Challenges before the Mughals
External Challenges

In the absence of internal strength, the Mughals could not
put a tough front against external challenges which came in
the form of several invasions from the north-west. The northwestern borders had been neglected by the later Mughals and
not much effort was expended in protecting the border.
59

View
Nader Shah was Mughal emperor for only fifty-seven days, in
1739, but those days created aftershocks that transformed India's
politics. They broke existing centres of authority, massively
shrinking the scope of Mughal power. They set loose bands of
mounted warriors who ransacked the countryside seeking wealth
from villages and towns. They pushed traders behind the walls
of whichever power had the strongest forts. For a short period
plunder, rather than negotiation, became the most effective tool
for creating new centres of wealth. Those fifty-seven days laid
the ground which allowed the East India Company to conquer
territory in India for the first time.
—Jon Wilson, India Conquered

Nadir Shah, the Persian emperor, attacked India in
1738-39, conquered Lahore and defeated the Mughal army
at Karnal on February 13, 1739. Later, Muhammad Shah was
captured, and Delhi looted and devastated. According to an
estimate, apart from the Peacock Throne and the Kohinoor
diamond, seventy crore rupees were collected from the
official treasury and the safes of the rich nobles. Nadir Shah
gained the strategically important Mughal territory to the
west of the Indus including Kabul. Thus, India once again
became vulnerable to the attacks from the north-west.
Ahmad Shah Abdali (or Ahmad Shah Durrani), who
was elected the successor of Nadir Shah after the latter’s
death in 1747, invaded India several times between 1748 and
1767. He continuously harassed the Mughals who tried to
buy peace in 1751-52 by ceding Punjab to him. In 1757,
Abdali captured Delhi and left behind an Afghan caretaker
to watch over the Mughal emperor. Before his return, Abdali
had recognised Alamgir II as the Mughal emperor and the
Rohilla chief, Najib-ud-Daula, as Mir Bakhshi of the empire,
who was to act as personal ‘supreme agent’ of Abdali. In
1758, Najib-ud-Daula was expelled from Delhi by the
Maratha chief, Raghunath Rao, who also captured Punjab. In
1759, Ahmad Shah Abdali returned to India to take revenge
on the Marathas. In 1761, Abdali defeated the Marathas in
the Third Battle of Panipat. The last of Abdali’s invasions
came in 1767.

Why Many Empire-shaking Battles at Panipat?
Panipat and its adjacent region, located in present Haryana on the
banks of the Yamuna and between the fertile plains of the Ganga
and Indus rivers, have witnessed several battles. These battles
changed the course of Indian history at different points of time.
● The first Battle of Panipat in 1526 was between Babur and
Ibrahim Lodi. The result of the battle laid the foundation of the
Mughal Empire by ending the rule of the Delhi Sultanate.
● The Second Battle of Panipat in 1556 was between Akbar
and Hemu; it decided in favour of the continuation of the Mughal
rule.
● The Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 between the Marathas
and Ahmad Shah Abdali put an end to the Maratha ambition of
ruling over India.
Why Panipat was a favourite battle field
● Panipat had a strategic location. One of the parties of the
war generally came from the north/northwest through the Khyber
Pass to get hold over Delhi, the political capital of northern India.
To move a military through rough terrains—deserts of Rajasthan
or the other northern areas infested with dense forests—was very
risky and difficult. On the other hand, the rulers at Delhi considered
Panipat as a confrontable strategic ground and hence they preferred
to take the fight there.
● Its proximity to Delhi made it easier for the Indian rulers
to transport weapons, military and food supplies etc., to the
battleground, and still keep the capital insulated from the conflict
at hand.
● Panipat’s surrounding region has a flat ground which was
suitable for cavalry movement—the main mode of warfare at the
time.
● After the construction of the Grand Trunk Road by Sher Shah
Suri (1540-45), Panipat was on this route. It became easier for
conquerors to find their way there.
● The duration of monsoon rainfall in the region is short in
comparison to other areas making it easier to fight.
● The artisans/smiths of these regions were experts in making
warfare-related materials and hence it became easier for forces of
both parties to replenish their war materials.

Weak Rulers after Aurangzeb—An
Internal Challenge
Bahadur Shah I (1709–March 1712) After a nearly
two-year-long war of succession, the 63-year-old Prince
Muazzam, the eldest son of Aurangzeb, became the emperor,
taking the title Bahadur Shah. He was later called Bahadur
Shah I). He had killed his brothers Muhammad Azam and Kam
Bakhsh in the war of succession. Khafi Khan gave the title
of Shah-i-Bekhabar to Bahadur Shah.
He adopted a pacific policy with the Marathas, the
Rajputs and the Jats. Shahu, the Maratha prince, was released
from Mughal captivity, and Rajput chiefs were confirmed in
their respective states. However, the Sikh leader Banda
Bahadur attacked the Muslims in Punjab and hence the
emperor took action against him. Bahadur Shah I died in
February 1712.
Jahandar Shah (March 1712-February 1713) With
the help of Zulfikar Khan, Jahandar Shah became the emperor.
Zulfikar Khan was appointed prime minister; he introduced
izara system to improve the financial condition of the
empire. Jahandar Shah abolished Jaziya.
Farrukhsiyar (1713-1719) After killing Jahandar Shah
with the help of Sayyid brothers—Abdulla Khan and Hussain
Ali (known as ‘King Makers’), Farrukhsiyar became the new
emperor. He followed a policy of religious tolerance by
abolishing Jaziya and pilgrimage tax. In 1717, he gave
farmans to the British. In 1719, the Sayyid brothers, with
the help of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, dethroned Farrukhsiyar.
Later, he was blinded and killed. It was the first time in the
Mughal history that an emperor was killed by his nobles.
Rafi-ud-Darajat (February 28 to June 4, 1719) He
ruled for the shortest period among the Mughals.
View
He (Bahadur Shah I) was the last Emperor of whom anything
favourable can be said. Henceforth, the rapid and complete
abasement and practical dissolution of the Empire are typified
in the incapacity and political insignificance of its sovereigns.
—Sidney Owen

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 63

Rafi-ud-Daula (June 6 to September 17, 1719) The
Sayyid brothers placed Rafi-ud-Daula with the title Shah
Jahan II on the throne. The new emperor was an opium
addict.
Muhammad Shah (1719-48) After the death of Rafiud-Daula, Raushan Akhtar became the choice of the Sayyid
Brothers. Muhammad Shah, as he came to be known in
history, was given the title of ‘Rangeela’ due to his luxurious
life-style.
Muhammad Shah, with the help of Nizam-ul-Mulk,
killed the Sayyid Brothers. In 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk became
the wazir and founded the independent state of Hyderabad.
In 1737, Baji Rao I, the Maratha Peshwa invaded Delhi with
a small army of 500 horsemen. In 1739, Nadir Shah defeated
the Mughals in the Battle of Karnal and later imprisoned
Muhammad Shah and annexed areas west of the Indus into
the Persian empire.
Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) Ahmad Shah was an
incompetent ruler who left the state affairs in the hands of
Udham Bai, the ‘Queen Mother’. Udham Bai, given the title
of Qibla-i-Alam, was a lady of poor intellect who ruled with
the help of her paramour, Javid Khan (a notorious eunuch).
Alamgir II (1754-1758) Alamgir II was a grandson of
Jahandar Shah. Ahmed Shah Abdali, the Iranian invader,
reached Delhi in January 1757. During his reign, the Battle
of Plassey was fought in June 1757.
Shahjehan III (1758-1759)
Shah Alam II (1759-1806) His reign saw two decisive
battles—the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) and the Battle
of Buxar (1764). In 1765, according to the terms of Treaty
of Allahabad (August 1765), he was taken under the East India
Company’s protection and resided at Allahabad. He also
issued a farman granting to the Company in perpetuity the
Diwani (the right to collect revenue) of Bengal, Bihar and
Orissa. In 1772, the Marathas took him to Delhi where he
lived till 1803. In 1803, he again accepted the protection
of the English, after the defeat of Daulat Rao Scindia by the
English. Afterwards, the Mughal emperors became the
pensioners of the English.

64  

Akbar II (1806-37) He gave the title of Raja to
Rammohan Rai. In 1835, the coins bearing the names of
Mughal emperors were stopped.
Bahadur Shah II (1837-1857) Bahadur Shah II or
Bahadur Shah Zafar (Zafar being his surname) was the last
Mughal emperor. The Revolt of 1857 had made a futile
attempt to declare him the Emperor of India. He was captured
by the English and sent to Rangoon where he died in 1862.
In legal terms, the Mughal Empire came to an end on
November 1, 1858 with the declaration of Queen Victoria.

Causes of Decline of Mughal
Empire
Why the Mughal Empire declined has been a subject of
debate among historians. Scholarly opinion can be divided
along two broad lines—those who view the matter as
generally empire-related and those who regard the
developments as region-related. The empire-related or
Mughal-centric view sees the causes of the decline within
the structure and functioning of the empire itself. The regionrelated view finds the causes of Mughal decline in the turmoil
and instability in the different parts of the empire. The
decline was due to both aspects.
The process of disintegration of the Mughal Empire
began during the reign of Aurangzeb, but it picked up
momentum only after his death in 1707. At his death,
conditions were not such that the process of decline could
not be checked. Although Mughal authority was challenged
by several chiefs and rulers, none could assert independence
in the face of the imperial might. The Sikhs, Marathas and
Rajputs did not possess the capacity to overthrow the empire;
they merely resisted Mughal power to gain and keep their
independence in their respective territories. Thus, if the
successors of Aurangzeb had been capable rulers, the empire
might not have fallen. Most of the emperors who came after
Aurangzeb proved to be incapable, weak and licentious
monarchs who hastened the process of disintegration of the
empire and, finally, its collapse.

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 65

The major factors which contributed to the downfall
of the Mughal Empire are discussed below.

Shifting Allegiance of Zamindars
Two classes shared the power of the State with the emperor
during the medieval period—the zamindars and the nobles.
The zamindars were hereditary owners of their lands who
enjoyed certain privileges on hereditary basis, and were
variously known as rais, rajas, thakurs, khuts or deshmukhs.
They occupied an important place in the empire because they
helped in the collection of revenue and in local administration,
for which they maintained soldiers. Though the Mughals had
tried to curb the power of the zamindars and maintain direct
contact with the peasants, they had not wholly succeeded.
During the reign of Aurangzeb itself, there was a marked
increase in the power and influence of the zamindars. The
biggest fallout of this was that regional loyalties were
encouraged. Many local zamindars helped the nobility, the
other powerful class within the empire, to take advantage of
the weakness of the empire and carve out independent
kingdoms for themselves.

Jagirdari Crisis
The nobility comprised people who were either assigned
large jagirs and mansabs or appointed subahdars of Mughal
subas and given the responsibility of maintaining these. To
this class belonged many Rajput rulers, subahdars and
mansabdars. Mughal rule has often been defined as “the rule
of the nobility”, because these nobles played a central role
in administering the empire. Although Akbar had provided a
well-knit organisation for them, there was divisiveness among
the nobility on the basis of religion, homeland and tribe, and
each category formed a group of its own. Mutual rivalry,
jealousy and contest for power among the various groups
during the rule of the later Mughals (in the absence of a
strong central leadership) not only reduced the prestige of
the emperor, but also contributed to the decline of the
empire.

66  
Views
The roots of the disintegration of the Mughal empire may be
found in the Medieval Indian economy; the stagnation of trade,
industry and scientific development within the limits of that
economy; the growing financial crisis which took the form of
a crisis of the jagirdari system and affected every branch of
state activity; the inability of the nobility to realise in the
circumstances their ambitions in the service of the state and
consequently the struggle of factions and the bid of ambitious
nobles for independent dominion; the inability of the Mughal
emperors to accommodate the Marathas and to adjust their
claims within the framework of the Mughal empire, and the
consequent breakdown of the attempt to create a composite
ruling class in India; and the impact of all these developments
on politics at the court and in the country, and upon the security
of the north-western passes. Individual failings and faults of
character also played their due role but they have necessarily
to be seen against the background of these deeper, more
impersonal factors.
—Satish Chandra, Parties and Politics
at the Mughal Court, 1707-40
Various explanations are put forward for the revolts which brought
about the collapse of the Mughal Empire... Here our main concern
is with what our 17th and early 18th century authorities have
to say. And it will be seen that they, at any rate, put the greatest
store by the economic and administrative causes of the upheaval
and know little of religious reaction or national consciousness...
Thus was the Mughal Empire destroyed. No new order was, or
could be, created by the forces ranged against it.
—Irfan Habib, The Agrarian System of
Mughal India
The more I study the period, the more I am convinced that
military inefficiency was the principal, if not the sole, cause of
that empire’s final collapse. All other defects and weaknesses
were as nothing in comparison with this...Long before it
disappeared, it had lost all military energy at the centre, and
was ready to crumble to pieces at the first touch. The rude
hand of no Persian or Afghan conqueror, no Nadir, no Ahmad

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 67

Abdali, the genius of no European adventurer, a Dupleix or a
Clive, was needed to precipitate it into the abyss. The empire
of the Mughals was already doomed before any of these had
appeared on the scene; and had they never been heard of there
can be little doubt that some Mahratta bandit or Sikh freebooter
would in due time have seated himself on the throne of Akbar
and Shahjahan.
—William Irvine, Army of the Indian Mughals
A common impression is, that...the decline, fall of the Mughal
Empire were due to the degeneracy of its sovereigns. But...it
was irretrievably ruined in the reign of Aurangzeb, a monarch
of great ability, energy and determination, but lacking in political
insight, and a bigoted Mussulman. He struck the first mortal
blow by reversing Akbar’s wise and generous policy of ignoring
distinctions of race and religion, and reimposing the jizya or poll
tax, on his Hindu subjects; whereby he estranged them, and
turned the noblest and most warlike of them—the Rajputs,
hitherto the staunchest supporters of the throne—into deadly and
persistent enemies. And Shivaji and his followers not only
vindicated their independence, but struck a second mortal blow
at the integrity of the Empire. They destroyed its military
reputation. They exhausted its accumulated treasure. They
spread disorder and devastation over the Deccan and beyond
it...They established an imperium in imperio. Thus the Empire,
though not dissolved, was hopelessly debilitated. The effective
authority of the central government was thenceforth in
abeyance...Nadir Shah, after inflicting the extremity of humiliation
on the Emperor and his capital, annexed the Imperial territory
west of the Indus. The dissolution of the Empire was complete.
—Sidney Owen, The Fall of the Mughal Empire
The Mughal Empire and with it the Maratha overlordship of
Hindustan fell because of the rottenness at the core of Indian
society. The rottenness showed itself in the form of military and
political helplessness. The country could not defend itself; royalty
was hopelessly depraved or imbecile; the nobles were selfish
and short-sighted; corruption, inefficiency and treachery disgraced
all branches of the public service. In the midst of this decay
and confusion, our literature, art and even true religion had
perished.
—J.N. Sarkar, Fall of the Mughal Empire, Vol. IV

68  

Rise of Regional Aspirations

Aurangzeb’s reign itself witnessed powerful regional groups
like the Jats, Sikhs and Marathas defying the authority of the
Mughal state in their bid to create kingdoms of their own.
They did not succeed in their efforts, but they influenced
the future course of political events in their respective
regions. Their continuous struggle against the empire for
political ascendancy weakened the empire considerably.
Aurangzeb, and after him Bahadur Shah I, by attempting to
suppress the Rajputs, spurred them to battle against the
Mughals. The later Mughals made an effort to follow a policy
of reconciliation with the Rajputs, but by then it was already
too late: the Rajputs no longer trusted the Mughals enough
to ally with them for the welfare of the empire.
Causes of the Mughals’ Downfall in a Nutshell
Some of the main causes for the decline of the Mughals, briefly
put, were as follows:
(i) The government of the Mughals was a personal despotism
and so its success depended on the character of the reigning
ruler. The later Mughals were worthless and neglected the
administration of the state.
(ii) With the absence of a definite law of succession, there always
occurred a war of succession; this weakened the stability of
the government, and fostered partisanship at the cost of
patriotism.
(iii) The degeneration of the rulers led to the degeneration of the
nobility, with factious quarrels and intrigues costing the empire
heavily.
(iv) The deterioration of the army also proved disastrous for the
empire.
(v) The empire had become too vast and unwieldy to be efficiently
governed from a central authority under weak rulers, especially
under the existing conditions of transport and communication.
(vi) Aurangzeb’s religious policy was largely responsible, leading
to revolts by Rajputs, Sikhs, Jats and Marathas.
(vii) Aurangzeb’s Deccan policy was a complete failure and was
an important cause of the downfall of the Mughal empire.
(viii) Invasions of Irani and Durrani kingdoms gave a death-blow
to the Mughal empire.

The Marathas too were becoming a formidable enemy.
Their aim was at first limited only to regaining control over
the region of Maharashtra; but it soon went on to include
getting legal sanction from the Mughal emperor for collecting
sardeshmukhi and chauth throughout India. They forged
northwards and, by 1740, succeeded in spreading their
influence over the provinces of Gujarat, Malwa and
Bundelkhand. The Rajput struggle against the empire and the
growing ambition and power of the Marathas, thus, adversely
affected the Mughal might.

Economic and Administrative Problems

The number of amirs and their ranks or mansabs had increased
sharply over time; there was little land left to be distributed
among them as jagirs. Aurangzeb tried to solve the problem
of acute shortage of jagirs or bejagiri by showing enhanced
income from the jagirs on record. But this was a shortsighted measure as the amirs tried to recover the recorded
income from their jagirs by pressurising the peasantry. So
both the amirs and the peasantry were antagonised. Then there
were the wars, the luxurious lifestyles of the emperors and
amirs alike, the reduction in khalisa land, all of which
burdened the state. The result was that the expenditure of
the state much exceeded its income.
There was, moreover, no significant scientific and
technological advance that could have improved a stagnant
economy. The once flourishing trade did not enrich the
empire’s coffers even as the inroads by European traders
grew along coastal India.
These economic and administrative problems only
multiplied following the death of Aurangzeb. The empire had
become too vast to be efficiently administered by a centralised
system when the rulers were weak and incompetent.

Rise of Regional States
The states that emerged as a result of the decline of the
Mughal Empire can be classified into the following three
broad categories:
(i) Successor States These were the Mughal provinces
that turned into states after breaking away from the empire.

70  

Though they did not challenge the sovereignty of the Mughal
ruler, the establishment of virtually independent and hereditary
authority by their governors showed the emergence of
autonomous polity in these territories. Some examples are
Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad.
(ii) Independent Kingdoms These states came into
existence primarily due to the destabilisation of the Mughal
control over the provinces, examples being Mysore and the
Rajput states.
(iii) The New States These were the states set up by
the rebels against the Mughal empire, examples being the
Maratha, the Sikh and the Jat states.

Survey of Regional Kingdoms
Hyderabad
The founder of the Asaf-Jah house of Hyderabad was Kilich
Khan, popularly known as Nizam-ul-Mulk. It was Zulfikar
Khan who had first conceived the idea of an independent state
in the Deccan. But with his death in 1713 the dream remained
unfulfilled. Kilich Khan, disgusted with the Mughal emperor
who had appointed Mubariz Khan as a full-fledged viceroy
of the Deccan, decided to fight Mubariz Khan. He defeated
and later killed Mubariz Khan in the Battle of Shakr-Kheda
(1724). He now assumed control of the Deccan. In 1725,
he became the viceroy and conferred on himself the title of
Asaf-Jah.
Awadh
The founder of the independent principality of Awadh was
Saadat Khan, popularly known as Burhan-ul-Mulk. Saadat
Khan was a Shia. He had joined in a conspiracy against the
Sayyid brothers, which resulted in his being given an increased
mansab. Later, driven out of the court, he was prompted to
found a new independent state. Saadat Khan committed
suicide due to pressure from Nadir Shah who was demanding
a huge booty from him. He was succeeded by Safdar Jang
as the Nawab of Awadh.
Bengal
Murshid Kuli Khan was the founder of the independent state
of Bengal. He was a capable ruler and made Bengal a

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 71

prosperous state. He was succeeded in 1727 by his son Shujaud-din. His successor, Sarfaraz Khan, was killed in 1740 by
Alivardi Khan, the deputy governor of Bihar at Gheria, who
assumed power and made himself independent of the Mughal
emperor by giving yearly tribute.
The Rajputs
The Rajputs tried to re-establish their independence in the
18th century. This forced the Mughal ruler Bahadur Shah I
to march against Ajit Singh (1708), who had formed an
alliance with Jai Singh II and Durgadas Rathor. But the
alliance was broken and the situation was saved for the
Mughals. At one time the Rajputs controlled the entire
territory extending from the south of Delhi up to the western
coast.
Mysore
Another important state to make its appearance in the
eighteenth century was that of Mysore. This territory located
at the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghats was ruled
by the Wodeyars. Various powers, interested in this territory,
turned the area into a constant battlefield. In the end the
Mysore state was brought under the rule of Haider Ali who
ruled the state but not without trouble. He was involved in
constant warfare with the British and so was his son Tipu
Sultan.
Kerala
Martanda Varma established an independent state of Kerala
with Travancore as his capital. He extended the boundaries
of his state from Kanyakumari to Cochin. He made efforts
to organise his army along the Western model and adopted
various measures to develop his state.
The Jats
The agriculturist Jat settlers living around Delhi, Mathura, and
Agra revolted against the oppressive policies of Aurangzeb.
After some initial setbacks, Churaman and Badan Singh
succeeded in setting up the Jat state of Bharatpur. But it was
under Suraj Mal that Jat power reached its zenith. He not
only provided an efficient system of administration but also

72  

greatly extended the territory of the state. His state included
territories from Ganga in the east to Chambal in the south
and included the Subahs of Agra, Mathura, Meerut and
Aligarh. However, the Jat state suffered a decline after the
death of Suraj Mal in 1763. Thereafter, the state split into
small areas controlled by petty zamindars who mainly lived
by plunder.
The Sikhs
Guru Gobind Singh transformed the Sikhs into a militant sect
in defence of their religion and liberties. Banda Bahadur, who
later assumed the leadership of the Sikhs in 1708, was
defeated and killed. In the wake of the invasions of Nadir
Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Sikhs once again asserted
their authority. At this stage they organised themselves into
12 misls or confederacies which exercised control over
different parts of the kingdom. The credit for establishing
a strong kingdom of Punjab goes to Ranjit Singh. He was
the son of Mahan Singh, the leader of the Sukarchakiya misl.
Ranjit Singh brought under control the area extending from
the Sutlej to the Jhelum. He conquered Lahore in 1799 and
Amritsar in 1802. By the Treaty of Amritsar with the British,
Ranjit Singh acknowledged the British right over the cisSutlej territories. Ranjit Singh proved to be an efficient
administrator. He greatly modernised his army with the help
of Europeans. But towards the close of his reign, the English
forced him to sign the Tripartite Treaty in 1838 with Shah
Shuja and the English Company whereby he agreed to provide
passage to the British troops through Punjab with a view to
placing Shah Shuja on the throne of Kabul. Ranjit Singh died
in 1839. His successors could not keep the state intact and,
soon enough, the British took control over it.
The Marathas
Perhaps the most formidable province to emerge was that
of the Marathas. Under the capable leadership of the Peshwas,
the Marathas uprooted the Mughal authority from Malwa and
Gujarat and established their rule. At one time they claimed
the right to be the chief inheritors of the Mughal dominion,
but their authority was challenged by Ahmed Shah Abdali in

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 73

the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The Marathas quickly
recovered from the defeat and offered the most formidable
challenge to the English East India Company in the struggle
for political supremacy in India.
Rohilakhand and Farukhabad
The states of Rohilakhand and the kingdom of the Bangash
Pathans were a fall out of the Afghan migration into India.
Large scale immigration of Afghans into India took place in
mid-18th century because of political and economic turmoil
in Afghanistan. Ali Muhammad Khan took advantage of the
collapse of authority in north India following Nadir Shah’s
invasion, to set up a petty kingdom, Rohilakhand. This was
the area of the Himalayan foothills between Kumaon in the
north and the Ganga in the south. The Rohillas, as the
inhabitants of Rohilakhand were known, suffered heavily at
the hands of the other powers in the area, the Jats and the
Awadh rulers and, later, the Marathas and the British.
Mohammad Khan Bangash, an Afghan, set up an independent
kingdom to the east of Delhi in the area around Farrukhabad,
during the reigns of Farrukhsiyar and Muhammad Shah.

Nature and Limitations of Regional States

The independent political systems that emerged in the
provinces continued to maintain ties with the Mughal imperial
authority and acknowledged the emperor’s importance as an
umbrella. Even rebel chieftains of the Marathas and Sikhs
recognised the Mughal emperor as the supreme authority.
The polity that emerged in these states was regional
in character, and functional with the collaborative support of
the different local groups like the zamindars, merchants, local
nobles and chieftains. The provincial rulers had to take care
of these various local interests in order to maintain themselves.
Of course, there were exceptions; for instance, in Mysore,
rulers did not recognise the local chieftains.
The regional states had certain limitations. The provincial
rulers failed to develop a system based on sound financial,
administrative and military organisation. Though some of
them tried to modernise, notably Mysore, on the whole, they
were backward in science and technology. Another drawback

74  

was the constant warfare these states had with the neighbouring
regional powers—wars in which none could ultimately
dominate. In fact, these states were strong enough to
challenge Mughal power, but none was able to replace it with
a stable polity at an all-India level.
The jagirdari crisis intensified as income from
agriculture declined, and the number of contenders for a
share of the surplus multiplied. Though trade, internal and
foreign, continued without disruption and even prospered, the
rest of the economy stagnated.

Socio-Economic Conditions
Eighteenth century India failed to make progress economically,
socially or culturally, at an adequate pace. India became a
land of contrasts because extreme poverty and extreme luxury
existed side by side. The common populace remained
impoverished, backward and oppressed and lived at the bare
subsistence level; the rich and the powerful enjoyed a life
of luxury and lavishness. But it is worth noting that the life
of the Indian masses was, by and large, better in the 18th
century than it was after 100 years of British rule.

Agriculture

Though agriculture was technically backward, it was worked
by the hard labour of peasants. But this hard working class
seldom got the fruits of their labour. Even though the
agricultural produce supported the rest of the society, a
peasant’s own reward was miserably inadequate. They were
forced to pay exorbitant amounts to the state, the zamindars,
the jagirdars, and the revenue-farmers. But this worsened
under British rule.

Trade and Industry

On account of being self-sufficient in handicrafts and
agricultural products, India did not import foreign goods on
a large scale. On the other hand, its industrial and agricultural
products were in good demand in foreign markets. Hence its
exports were more than its imports; trade was balanced by
import of silver and gold. India was known as a sink of
precious metals.

—Peter the Great
India was a far greater industrial and manufacturing nation than
any in Europe or any other in Asia. Her textile goods—the fine
products of her looms, in cotton, wool, linen and silk—were
famous over the civilised world; so were her exquisite jewellery
and her precious stones cut in every lovely form; so were her
pottery, porcelains, ceramics of every kind, quality, color and
beautiful shape; so were her fine works in metal—iron, steel,
silver and gold.
She had great architecture—equal in beauty to any in the
world. She had great engineering works. She had great merchants,
great businessmen, great bankers and financiers. Not only was
she the greatest shipbuilding nation, but she had great commerce
and trade by land and sea which extended to all known civilised
countries. Such was the India which the British found when they
came.
—J.T. Sunderland
For centuries the handloom weavers of Bengal had produced
some of the world’s most desirable fabrics, especially the fine
muslins, light as ‘woven air’, that were coveted by European
dressmakers. As late as the mid-eighteenth century, Bengal’s
textiles were still being exported to Egypt, Turkey and Persia
in the West, and to Java, China and Japan in the East, along
well-established trade routes, as well as to Europe.

76  

Masulipatnam, Aurangabad, Chicacole, Vishakhapatnam,
Bangalore, Coimbatore, Madurai, etc.; Kashmir was a centre
of woollen manufactures.
Ship-building Industry Maharashtra, the Andhra region
and Bengal were the leaders in ship-building. Indian shipping
also flourished on the Kerala coast at Calicut and Quilon.
The Zamorin of Calicut used the Muslim Kunjali Maraikkars
(who were well known for their seafaring ability) for his navy.
Shivaji Bhonsle’s navy put up a good defence on the west
coast against the Portuguese. According to Bipan Chandra,
the European companies bought many Indian-made ships for
their use.

Status of Education

The education imparted in 18th-century India was still
traditional which could not match with the rapid developments
in the West. The knowledge was confined to literature, law,
religion, philosophy, and logic and excluded the study of
physical and natural sciences, technology and geography. In
fact, due to over-reliance placed on ancient learning, any
original thought got discouraged. Elementary education among
the Hindus and the Muslims was quite widespread. The Hindu
and Muslim elementary schools were called pathshalas and
maktabs respectively. The education was confined to reading,
writing, and arithmetic. Children from the lower caste
sometimes attended the schools, but female presence was
rare.
Chatuspathis or Tols, as they were called in Bihar and
Bengal, were the centres of higher education. Some of the
famous centres for Sanskrit education were Kasi (Varanasi),
Tirhut (Mithila), Nadia and Utkala. Madrasahs were the
institutions of higher learning for Persian and Arabic, Persian
being the court language and learnt by the Muslims as well
as the Hindus. Azimabad (Patna) was a famous centre for
Persian education. People interested in the study of the Quran
and Muslim theology had to acquire proficiency in Arabic.

Societal Set-up
Many Castes, Many Sects
The society of 18th century India was characterised by
traditional outlook and stagnation. Though there existed a

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 77

certain degree of broad cultural unity, people were divided
by caste, religion, region, tribe and language. The family
system was primarily patriarchal and caste was the central
feature of the social life of the Hindus. Apart from the four
varnas, Hindus were divided into numerous sub-castes which
permanently fixed their place in the social scale. Though the
choice of profession was mainly determined by caste
considerations, exceptions occurred on a large scale, making
caste status quite fluid in some parts of the country. Caste
councils and panchayats enforced caste norms and regulations.
Even though Islam enjoined social equality on the Muslims,
they too were divided by considerations of caste, race, tribe
and status. Religious considerations not only kept the Sunni
and Shia nobles apart but also the Irani, Afghan, Turani and
Hindustani Muslim nobles and officials apart from one
another. The sharif Muslims consisting of nobles, scholars,
priests and army affairs often looked down upon the ajlaf
Muslims or the lower class Muslims in a manner similar to
the way of the higher-caste Hindus treated the lower-caste
Hindus. Religious conversions occurred and caste proved to
be a major divisive force and element of disintegration in
18th century India.
Position of Women in Society
In the patriarchal family system in India (except in some
social groups in Kerala), women possessed little individuality
of their own, though there were a few exceptions. While
upper class women remained at home, lower class women
worked in fields and outside their homes supplementing the
family income. Certain outdated and exploitative social
customs and traditions such as the purdah, sati, child
marriage, polygamy did exist which hindered the progress of
women. The plight of the Hindu widow was usually miserable.
View
A Hindu woman can go anywhere alone, even in the most
crowded places, and she need never fear the impertinent looks
and jokes of idle loungers.
—Abbe Dubois, commented at beginning
of the nineteenth century

78  

The evil of dowry was especially widespread in Bengal and
Rajputana. Sensitive Indians were often touched by the hard
and harsh life of the widows. Raja Sawai Jai Singh of Amber
and the Maratha General Prashuram Bhau tried to promote
widow remarriage but failed.
Menace of Slavery
European travellers and administrators, who came in the 17th
century, reported the widespread prevalence of slaves in
India. It is believed that some people were compelled to sell
their offspring due to economic distress, famines, natural
calamities and extreme poverty. Generally higher classes of
Rajputs, Khatris and Kayasthas kept women slave for domestic
work. However, the status of slaves in India was better than
that in Europe. Slaves, were usually treated as hereditary
servants rather than as menials. Marriages took place among
the slaves, and the offspring coming out of such wedlock
were considered free citizens.
The advent of Europeans heightened the slavery and
slave trade in India. European trading companies purchased
slaves from the markets of Bengal, Assam and Bihar and took
them to the European and American market. Abyssinian slaves
were sold at Surat, Madras and Calcutta.

Developments in Art, Architecture
and Culture

The decline of the imperial Mughals forced talented people
to seek the patronage of newly established state courts like
Hyderabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Murshidabad, Patna, Kashmir,
etc.
At Lucknow, Asaf-ud-Daula built the bada Imambara
in 1784. In the first half of the 18th century, Sawai Jai Singh
built the pink city of Jaipur and five astronomical observatives
at Delhi, Jaipur, Benares, Mathura and Ujjain. He also
prepared a set of time-tables called Jij Muhammad-shahi,
to help the people in the study of astronomy. In the south,
in Kerala, the Padmanabhapuram Palace, famous for its
architecture and mural paintings, was constructed.
New schools of painting were born and achieved
distinction. The paintings of the Rajputana and Kangra
schools became prominent and revealed new vitality and taste.

India on the Eve of British Conquest

 79

A distinct feature of the literary life of the 18th century
was the growth of Urdu language and poetry. It was the period
of Urdu poets like Mir, Sauda, Nazir and Mirza Ghalib (19th
century). In south India, Malayalam literature flourished
under the patronage of the Travancore rulers. Kanchan
Nambiar was a noted Malayalam poet. The Tamil language
was enriched by sittar poetry. Tayumanavar (1706-44), one
of the best exponents of sittar poetry, protested against the
abuses of temple-rule and the caste system. Heer Ranjha,
the romantic epic in Punjabi literature, was composed by
Warris Shah. In Sindhi literature, Shah Abdul Latif composed
Risalo, a collection of poems. These are just some examples
of literary works in regional languages.

Chapter 5

Expansion and
Consolidation of British
Power in India
The British Imperial History
The entire imperial history of Britain can be periodised into
two phases, the ‘first empire’ stretching across the Atlantic
towards America and the West Indies, and the ‘second
empire’ beginning around 1783 (Peace of Paris) and swinging
towards the East—Asia and Africa. The imperial history of
Britain started with the conquest of Ireland in the sixteenth
century. The English then sprang up as the ‘new Romans’,
charged with civilising so-called backward races throughout
the world. For this, the post-Enlightenment intellectuals of
Britain, in particular, and of Europe, in general, started
certifying themselves as civilised vis-a-vis the Orient peoples
and others. Owing to various spatial and situational forces
the nature of imperial ideology of Britain changed over time
but its fundamentals remained the same.

Was the British Conquest
Accidental or Intentional?
Historians have debated over the fundamental query, whether
the British conquest of India was accidental or intentional.
John Seeley leads the group which says that the British
81

Views
Our acquisition of India was made blindly. Nothing great that
has ever been done by Englishman was done so unintentionally
and so accidentally, as the conquest of India.
—John Seeley
The deeper reasons of intention and motive for the Company’s
acquisition of vast areas of territory are more obscure...for the
expansion occurred in such different parts of India at different
times. In each particular situation the precise British interests
at stake varied, and the perceived danger to them; as did the
relative weight in decision-making of different British groups
concerned in Indian affairs.
—Judith Brown

conquest of India was made blindly, unintentionally and
accidentally, and in a “fit of absent-mindedness”. This school
of opinion argues that the British came to trade in India and
had no desire to acquire territories or to squander their
profits on war waged for territorial expansion. The English,
it is argued, were unwillingly drawn into the political turmoil
created by the Indians themselves, and were almost forced
to acquire territories.
The other group says that the British came to India with
the clear intention of establishing a large and powerful
empire, a plan which they completed by working on it bit
by bit over the years. They dismiss as propaganda the claim
of the peaceful intent and political neutrality of the English
East India Company in its early days.
Both the schools of opinion appear to be overstating
their viewpoints. Initially, perhaps, the Company officials
started acquiring territory just to promote and protect their
trade interests, especially when they saw how factionalised
the political situation was. They came to realise how easily
they could pit one local ruler against another and began to
interfere in local politics and, in the process, acquired
territories. But later on the British politicians back in Britain
and the administrators sent by them to India worked on a
clear desire and plan to acquire territories and establish an
empire.
The enormous profits from the trade in the East,

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  83

notably India, attracted the English traders (the Company) as
it did other Europeans. A desire for quick profits, personal
ambitions of individuals, plain avarice and effects of political
developments in Europe were some of the factors that made
the British increase their political clout in India. At times,
they waged wars to protect their commercial interests and,
at others, they did so to protect their Indian allies from the
attacks of potential rivals. B.L. Grover writes: “Lord Wellesley
resorted to aggressive application of the subsidiary alliance
system to extend British dominion in India as a defensive
counter measure against the imperialistic designs of France
and Russia. From 1798 to 1818 the British motives were
consciously imperialistic. Lord Hastings further carried the
policy of Wellesley and treated India as a conquered rather
than an acquired country. Thereafter, the British seemed to
work on a set design to conquer the whole of India, and even
some neighbouring states.”

When did the British
Period Begin in India?
In mid-18th-century India, various historical forces were at
work, consequent to which the country moved towards a new
direction. Some historians regard the year 1740, when the
Anglo-French struggle for supremacy in India began in the
wake of the War of Austrian Succession in Europe, as the
beginning of the British period. Some see the year 1757,
when the British defeated the Nawab of Bengal at Plassey,
as the designated date. Still others regard 1761, the year of
the Third Battle of Panipat when the Marathas were defeated
by Ahmad Shah Abdali, as the beginning of this phase of
Indian history. However, all such chronological landmarks are
somewhat arbitrary because the political transformation which
began around that time took about eighty years to complete.
For instance, as we think of 1761, the British would
certainly come to mind (because of their victory over the
Nawab of Bengal at Plassey and over the French) but we
would not entirely write off the Marathas and would probably
also consider the prospects of Haidar Ali. In fact, it was a

84  

period of Indian history which it would probably be a mistake
to interpret in terms of what we know in the present.
Nonetheless, the circumstances under which the British
succeeded are not clear, and the few bottlenecks which they
faced were not of a serious nature. It is this paradox which
makes the causes of British success in establishing an empire
in India a matter of considerable interest.

Causes of British Success
in India
The entire process of expansion and consolidation of the
British power in India took almost a century. In these hundred
odd years the English used many diplomatic and military
tactics, apart from other mechanisms, to finally emerge as
the rulers of India. Both war and administrative policies were
used by the English to impose their power over various
kingdoms and finally to consolidate their own rule over the
entire India. The British were not averse to using unscrupulous
tactics to exploit a situation or a regional ruler to get their
own way. The causational forces and factors for the success
of the British are as follows.

Superior Arms, Military and Strategy

The firearms used by the English, which included muskets
and cannons, were better than the Indian arms both in speed
of firing and in range. On realising this, many Indian rulers
imported European arms and employed European officers to
train their troops but unfortunately the Indian military officers
and the ranks could never match the English officers
and English armies; in the absence of originality, the
military officers and armies of Indian rulers became mere
imitators.

Better Military Discipline and
Regular Salary

A regular system of payment of salaries and a strict regime
of discipline were the means by which the English Company
ensured that the officers and the troops were loyal. On their
part, most of the Indian rulers did not have enough money

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  85

to pay salaries regularly. The Marathas at times diverted their
military campaigns to collect revenue so as to pay their
troops. Also, the Indian rulers were dependent on personal
retinues or a rabble of mercenary elements who were not
amenable to discipline and could turn rebellious or join the
opponents when the going was not good.

Civil Discipline and Fair Selection System

The Company officers and troops were given charge on the
basis of their reliability and skill and not on hereditary or
caste and clan ties. They themselves were subject to strict
discipline and were aware of the objectives of their campaigns.
In contrast, the Indian administrators and military officers
were appointed on the basis of caste and personal relations,
often disregarding merit and ability. As a result, their
competence was doubtful and they often tended to be
rebellious and disloyal in order to pursue their own interests.

Brilliant Leadership and Support of
Second Line Leaders

Clive, Warren Hastings, Elphinstone, Munro, Marquess of
Dalhousie, etc., displayed rare qualities of leadership. The
English also had the advantage of a long list of secondary
leaders like Sir Eyre Coote, Lord Lake and Arthur Wellesley
who fought not for the leader but for the cause and the glory
of their country. The Indian side too had brilliant leaders like
Haidar Ali, Tipu Sultan, Chin Kulich Khan, Madhu Rao
Sindhia, and Yashwant Rao Holkar, but they often lacked a
team of second line trained personnel. Moreover, the Indian
leaders were as much fighting against one another as against
the British. The spirit of fighting for a united cause was not
their motivation. Thus they often supported the British against
neighbouring rulers. The consciousness of ‘India’ was lacking.

Strong Financial Backup

The income of the Company was adequate enough to pay its
shareholders handsome dividends as also to finance the
English wars in India. Furthermore, England was earning
fabulous profits from its trade with the rest of the world.
This vast amount of resources in money, materials and men

86  

was available to the British in times of need, thanks to their
superiority in sea power.

Nationalist Pride

An economically thriving British people believing in material
advancement and proud of their national glory faced the
‘weak, divided-amongst-themselves Indians’ bereft of a sense
of unified political nationalism. The lack of materialistic
vision among Indians was also a reason for the success of
the English Company.

British Conquest of Bengal
Bengal on the Eve of British Conquest

Bengal, the richest province of the Mughal Empire included
present day Bangladesh, and its Nawab had authority over the
region constituting present day states of Bihar and Odisha.
Exports from Bengal to Europe consisted of raw products
such as saltpetre, rice, indigo, pepper, sugar, silk, cotton
textiles, handicrafts, etc. The English East India Company had
vital commercial interests in trading in Bengal, as nearly 60
per cent of the British imports from Asia consisted of goods
from Bengal. During the 1630s, regular contact of the British
with Bengal continued when they established factories in
Balasore, Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna and Dacca. By the
1690s, the foundation of Calcutta by the English company
completed the process of English commercial settlement in
Bengal. The Company paid a sum of Rs 3,000 (£ 350) per
annum to the Mughal emperor who allowed them to trade
freely in Bengal. In contrast, the Company’s exports from
Bengal were worth more than £ 50,000 per annum.
In 1700, Murshid Quli Khan became the Dewan of
Bengal and ruled till his death in 1727. He was succeeded
by his son-in-law, Shujauddin who ruled till 1739. After that,
for a year (1739-40), Sarfaraz Khan, an incapable son of
Murshid Quli Khan, became the ruler; he was killed by
Alivardi Khan. Alivardi Khan ruled till 1756 and also stopped
paying tributes to the Mughal emperior. Under the rule of
these rulers, Bengal made unprecedented progress. There
were other factors too, which made Bengal prosperous, for

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  87

instance, the rest of India was disturbed by inter-border
disputes, the Maratha invasions, Jat revolts, and external
invasions by Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali. The region
of Bengal was fortunate enough to escape these challenges.
The population of Calcutta rose from 15,000 (in 1706) to
100,000 (in 1750) and other cities like Dacca and
Murshidabad became highly populous.
Almost all the governors of Bengal strongly resented
the special privileges enjoyed by the English company as it
meant a huge loss to the provincial exchequer. So the friction
between the English commercial interests and the Bengal
government became the chief cause for conflict between the
two. During a short period between 1757 and 1765, the power
gradually got transferred from the Nawabs of Bengal to the
British with the latter defeating the former.

Alivardi Khan and the English

In 1741, Alivardi Khan, the Deputy Governor of Bihar, killed
the Nawab of Bengal Sarfaraz Khan in a battle and certified
his own position as the new Subahdar of Bengal by paying
a large sum of money to the Mughal Emperor, Muhammad
Shah. Alivardi Khan ruled for 15 years, during which he
fought off the Marathas. The English, too, took the advantage
of the Maratha incursions in Bengal, by obtaining a permission
from the nawab to dig a ditch and throw up an entrenchment
around their settlement of Fort William. Later, Alivardi
Khan’s apprehensions were drawn to the Carnatic region,
where the European companies had usurped all power; on
realising this, he was urged to expel the Europeans from
Bengal. But he died in April 1756 and was succeeded by his
grandson, Siraj-ud-daula, the son of Alivardi’s youngest
daughter.

Challenges Before Siraj-ud-daula

A youth just in his twentieth year, Siraj inherited many
troubles from his grandfather. He had a rival in his cousin,
the Nawab of Purnea, Shaukat Jang; a hostile aunt, Ghasiti
Begum, a childless widow; a rebellious commander of the
army, Mir Jafar, husband of Alivardi Khan’s sister; and an
alarmed (Hindu) subject population. There was a dominant

88  

group in his court comprising Jagat Seth, Omichand, Rai
Ballabh, Rai Durlabh and others who were opposed to him.
To these internal rivals were added the threat to Siraj’s
position from the ever-growing commercial activity of the
English company. Impulsive by nature and lacking experience,
Siraj felt insecure, and this prompted him to act in ways
which proved counter productive. He defeated Shaukat Jang
and killed him in a battle, divested Ghasiti Begum of her
treasures and secured her, and dismissed Mir Jafar, appointing
Mir Madan in his place. A Kashmiri officer Mohan Lal was
appointed as the overall administrator, and he acted almost
like a prime minister.

The Battle of Plassey
Prelude to the Battle
The officials of the Company made rampant misuse of its
trade privileges that adversely affected the nawab’s finances.
The English fortified Calcutta without the nawab’s permission.
The Company further tried to mislead him, and compounded
their sin by giving asylum to a political fugitive, Krishna Das,
son of Raj Ballabh who had fled with immense treasures
against the nawab’s will. The Company, on its part, suspected
that Siraj would drastically reduce its trade privileges in
collusion with the French in Bengal. Thus, when Siraj attacked
and seized the English fort at Calcutta, it brought their
hostility into the open.
Mention may be made here of the much propagated
‘Black Hole Tragedy’. Siraj-ud-daula is believed to have
imprisoned 146 English persons who were lodged in a very
tiny room due to which 123 of them died of suffocation.
However, historians either do not believe this story, or say
that the number of victims must have been much smaller.
The Battle
The arrival of a strong force under the command of Robert
Clive at Calcutta from Madras strengthened the English
position in Bengal. Clive forged a secret alliance with the
traitors of the nawab—Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh, Jagat Seth (an
influential banker of Bengal) and Omichand. Under the deal,
Mir Jafar was to be made the nawab who in turn would reward

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  89

the Company for its services. The secret alliance of the
Company with the conspirators further strengthened the
English position. So the English victory in the Battle of
Plassey (June 23, 1757) was decided before the battle was
even fought. Due to the conspiracy of the nawab’s officials,
the 50,000-strong force of Siraj was defeated by a handful
of Clive’s forces. Siraj-ud-daula was captured and murdered
by the order of Mir Jafar’s son, Miran. The Battle of Plassey
placed at the disposal of the English vast resources of Bengal.
After Plassey, the English virtually monopolised the trade and
commerce of Bengal.
Significance of Battle of Plassey
As a result of this victory, Mir Jafar became the Nawab of
Bengal. He gave large sums of money plus the zamindari
of 24 parganas to the English.
The Battle of Plassey had political significance for it
laid the foundation of the British empire in India; it has been
rightly regarded as the starting point of British rule in India.
The battle established the military supremacy of the English
in Bengal. Their main rivals, the French, were ousted. They
obtained a grant of territories for the maintenance of a
properly equipped military force, and their prestige increased
manifold. But there was no apparent change in the form of
government, though the supreme control of affairs passed to
Clive, on whose support the new nawab, Mir Jafar, was
entirely dependent for maintaining his newly acquired position.
The sovereignty of the English over Calcutta was recognised,
and the English posted a Resident at the nawab’s court.

Mir Kasim and the Treaty of 1760

Mir Jafar was increasingly irritated by the interference of
Clive. He entered into a conspiracy with the Dutch at
Chinsura. But the Dutch were defeated and humbled by the
English forces at Bedara in November 1759. The treachery
of Mir Jafar and his failure to make the payments due to
the Company, annoyed the English. Meanwhile, Miran, the
son of Jafar died and there started a fight for the nawabship
of Bengal between Mir Kasim, the son-in-law of Mir Jafar,
and Miran’s son. Vansittart, the new Governor of Calcutta,

90  

agreed to support Mir Kasim’s claim after a treaty between
Mir Kasim and the Company was signed in 1760. Important
features of the treaty were as follows:
(i) Mir Kasim agreed to cede to the Company the
districts of Burdwan, Midnapur and Chittagong.
(ii) The Company would get half of the share in chunam
trade of Sylhet.
(iii) Mir Kasim agreed to pay off the outstanding dues
to the Company.
(iv) Mir Kasim promised to pay a sum of rupees five
lakh towards financing the Company’s war efforts in
southern India.
(v) It was agreed that Mir Kasim’s enemies were the
Company’s enemies, and his friends, the Company’s
friends.
(vi) It was agreed that tenants of the nawab’s territory
would not be allowed to settle in the lands of the
Company, and vice-versa.
Under the pressure of the Company, Mir Jafar decided
to resign in favour of Mir Kasim. A pension of Rs 1,500
per annum was fixed for Mir Jafar.
Steps taken by Mir Kasim
Mir Kasim was the ablest nawab among the successors of
Alivardi Khan. After assuming power, Mir Kasim shifted the
capital from Murshidabad to Munger in Bihar. The move was
taken to allow a safe distance from the Company at Calcutta.
His other important steps were reorganising the bureaucracy
with the men of his own choice and remodelling the army
to enhance its skill and efficiency.

The Battle of Buxar
Prelude to Battle
The Company had thought that Mir Kasim would prove to
be an ideal puppet for them. However, Mir Kasim belied the
expectations of the Company. Ram Narayan, the deputygovernor of Bihar, was not responding to repeated requests
by the nawab to submit the accounts of the revenues of Bihar.
Mir Kasim could not tolerate this open defiance of his
authority. But Ram Narayan was supported by the English

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  91

officials of Patna. The misuse of the Company’s dastak or
trade permit (a permit which exempted the goods specified
from payment of duties) by Company officials also resulted
in tensions between the nawab and the English.
The misuse of the dastak meant the loss of tax revenue
to the nawab. It also made the local merchants face unequal
competition with the Company merchants. By an imperial
farman, the English company had obtained the right to trade
in Bengal without paying transit dues or tolls. However, the
servants of the Company also claimed the same privileges
for their private trade. The Company’s servants also sold
dastak to Indian merchants for a commission. Besides, they
used coercive methods to get goods at cheaper rates, which
was against the spirit of the duty-free trade. The duty-free
trade simply meant buying cheap in an otherwise competitive
market. Mir Kasim decided to abolish the duties altogether,
but the British protested against this and insisted upon having
preferential treatment as against other traders.
The Nawab-Company tussle over transit duty led to the
outbreak of wars between the English and Mir Kasim in 1763.
The English gained successive victories at Katwah,
Murshidabad, Giria, Sooty and Munger. Mir Kasim fled to
Awadh (or Oudh) and formed a confederacy with the Nawab
of Awadh, Shuja-ud-daulah, and the Mughal Emperor, Shah
Alam II, with a view to recover Bengal from the English.
The Battle
The combined armies of Mir Kasim, the Nawab of Awadh
and Shah Alam II were defeated by the English forces under
Major Hector Munro at Buxar on October 22, 1764 in a
closely contested battle. The English campaign against Mir
Kasim was short but decisive.
The importance of this battle lay in the fact that not
only the Nawab of Bengal but also the Mughal Emperor of
India was defeated by the English. The victory made the
English a great power in northern India and contenders for
the supremacy over the whole country.
After the battle, Mir Jafar, who was made Nawab in
1763 when relations between Mir Kasim and the Company
became strained, agreed to hand over the districts of

92  
Robert Clive
A survey of this period of British rule cannot be complete without
a reference to Robert Clive, who joined the army after resigning
from a clerk’s post. He was instrumental in laying the foundations
of British power in India. He was made the Governor of Bengal
twice from 1757 to 1760 and then from 1765 to 1767. He
administered Bengal under the dual government system till his return
to England where he allegedly committed suicide in 1774.

Midnapore, Burdwan and Chittagong to the English for the
maintenance of their army. The English were also permitted
duty-free trade in Bengal, except for a duty of two per cent
on salt. After the death of Mir Jafar, his minor son, Najimud-daula, was appointed nawab, but the real power of
administration lay in the hands of the naib-subahdar, who
could be appointed or dismissed by the English.

The Treaty of Allahabad

Robert Clive concluded two important treaties at Allahabad
in August 1765—one with the Nawab of Awadh and the other
with the Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II.
Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula agreed to:
(i) surrender Allahabad and Kara to Emperor Shah
Alam II;
(ii) pay Rs 50 lakh to the Company as war indemnity;
and
(iii) give Balwant Singh, Zamindar of Banaras, full
possession of his estate.
Shah Alam II agreed to:
(i) reside at Allahabad, to be ceded to him by the
Nawab of Awadh, under the Company’s protection;
(ii) issue a farman granting the diwani of Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa to the East India Company in lieu
of an annual payment of Rs 26 lakh; and
(iii) a provision of Rs 53 lakh to the Company in return
for nizamat functions (military defence, police,
and administration of justice) of the said provinces.
Clive did not want to annex Awadh because it would
have placed the Company under an obligation to protect an

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  93

extensive land frontier from the Afghan and the Maratha
invasions. The treaty made the Nawab a firm friend of the
Company, and turned Awadh into a buffer state. Similarly,
Clive’s arrangement with Shah Alam II was inspired by
practical considerations. It made the emperor a useful ‘rubber
stamp’ of the Company. Besides, the emperor’s farman
legalised the political gains of the Company in Bengal.
Mir Kasim, the dethroned Nawab of Bengal, spent the
rest of his life in abject misery as a homeless wanderer and
died in June 1777.

Dual Government in Bengal (1765-72)

After the battle of Buxar, the East India Company became
the real masters of Bengal. Robert Clive introduced the dual
system of government, i.e., the rule of the two—the Company
and the Nawab—in Bengal in which both the diwani, i.e.,
collecting revenues, and nizamat, i.e., police and judicial
functions, came under the control of the Company. The
Company exercised diwani rights as the diwan and the
nizamat rights through its right to nominate the deputy
subahdar. The Company acquired the diwani functions from
the emperor and nizamat functions from the subahdar of
Bengal.
The system held a great advantage for the Company.
It left the appearance of authority to the puppet Indian ruler,
while keeping the sovereign power in the hands of the
Company. The nawab was responsible for maintaining peace
and order, but he depended both for funds and forces upon
the Company because the latter controlled the army and
revenues.
For the exercise of diwani functions, the Company
appointed two deputy diwans, Mohammad Reza Khan for
Bengal and Raja Sitab Roy for Bihar. Mohammad Reza Khan
also acted as deputy nazim or deputy subahdar.
The dual system led to an administrative breakdown and
proved disastrous for the people of Bengal. Neither the
Company nor the Nawab cared for administration and public
welfare. Warren Hastings did away with the dual system in
1772.

Whether regarded as a duel between the foreigner and the native,
or as an event pregnant with vast permanent consequences,
Buxar takes rank amongst the most decisive battles ever fought.
Not only did the victory of the English save Bengal, not only
did it advance the British frontier to Allahabad, but it bound the
rulers of Awadh to the conqueror by ties of admiration, of
gratitude, of absolute reliance and trust, ties which made them
for the ninety-four years that followed the friends of his friends
and the enemies of his enemies.

Mysore’s Resistance to the
Company
The Wodeyar / Mysore Dynasty

After the battle of Talikota (1565) gave a deadly blow to
the great kingdom of Vijayanagara, many small kingdoms
emerged from its remnants. In 1612 a Hindu kingdom under
the Wodeyars emerged in the region of Mysore. Chikka
Krishnaraja Wodeyar II ruled from 1734 to 1766. During the
second half of the 18th century, Mysore emerged as a
formidable power under the leadership of Haidar Ali and Tipu
Sultan. The English felt their political and commercial
interests in south India was threatened because of Mysore’s
proximity with the French and Haidar Ali and Tipu’s control
over the rich trade of the Malabar coast. Mysore’s power
was also seen as a threat to the control of the English over
Madras.

Rise of Haidar Ali

In the early 18th century two brothers, Nanjaraj (the
sarvadhikari) and Devaraj (the Dulwai) had reduced Chikka
Krishnaraja Wodeyar to a mere puppet. Haidar Ali, born in
1721 in an obscure family, started his career as a horseman
in the Mysore army under the ministers, Nanjaraj and Devaraj.

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  95

Though uneducated, he possessed a keen intellect and was
a man of great energy and determination.
Repeated incursions of the Marathas and of the Nizam’s
troops into the territories of Mysore resulted in heavy
financial demands made by the aggressors from Mysore.
Mysore became financially and politically weak. The need
of the hour was a leader with high degree of military powers
and diplomatic skill. Haidar Ali fulfilled that need and
usurped the royal authority by becoming the de facto ruler
of Mysore in 1761. He realised that the exceedingly mobile
Marathas could be contained only by a swift cavalry, that the
cannons of the French-trained Nizami army could be silenced
only by an effective artillery, and that the superior arms from
the West could only be matched by arms brought from the
same place or manufactured with the same know-how.
Haidar Ali took the help of the French to set up an
arms factory at Dindigul (now in Tamil Nadu), and also
introduced Western methods of training for his army. He also
started to use his considerable diplomatic skill to
outmanoeuvre his opponents. With his superior military skill
he captured Dod Ballapur, Sera, Bednur and Hoskote in 176163, and brought to submission the troublesome Poligars of
South India (in what is now Tamil Nadu). Recovering from
their defeat at Panipat, the Marathas under Madhavrao attacked
Mysore, and defeated Haidar Ali in 1764, 1766, and 1771.
To buy peace, Haidar Ali had to give them large sums of
money, but after Madhavrao’s death in 1772, Haidar Ali
raided the Marathas a number of times during 1774-76, and
recovered all the territories he had previously lost, besides
capturing new areas.

First Anglo-Mysore War (1767-69)
Background
After their easy success in Bengal, the English were confident
of their military strength. They concluded a treaty with the
Nizam of Hyderabad (1766) persuading him to give them the
Northern Circars (region) in lieu of which they said they
would protect the Nizam from Haidar Ali. Haidar already had
territorial disputes with the Nawab of Arcot and differences
with the Marathas.

96  

Changing Alliances
The Nizam, the Marathas, and the English allied together
against Haidar Ali. Haidar acted with considerable tact and
diplomatic skill. He paid the Marathas to turn them neutral
and, promising to share conquered territories with the Nizam,
converted the Nizam into his ally. He then joined the Nizam
to attack the Nawab of Arcot.
Course of War
The war continued for a year-and-a-half without any conclusion.
Haidar changed his strategy and suddenly appeared before the
gates of Madras. There was complete chaos and panic at
Madras forcing the English to conclude a very humiliating
treaty with Haidar on April 4, 1769—Treaty of Madras. The
treaty provided for the exchange of prisoners and mutual
restitution of conquests. Haidar Ali was promised the help
of the English in case he was attacked by any other power.

Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780-84)
Background
Haidar Ali accused the English of breach of faith and nonobservance of the Treaty of Madras when in 1771 he was
attacked by the Marathas, and the English failed to come to
his aid. Also, he found that the French were much more
helpful than the English in meeting his army’s requirement
of guns, saltpetre and lead. Consequently, through Mahe, a
French possession on the Malabar coast, some French war
material was brought to Mysore. Meanwhile, the American
war of independence had broken out in which the French were
on the side of the rebels against the English. Under the
circumstances, Haidar Ali’s friendship with the French caused
even more concern to the English. They therefore tried to
capture Mahe, which Haidar regarded to be under his
protection. Haidar considered the English attempt to capture
Mahe a direct challenge to his authority.
Course of War
Haidar forged an anti-English alliance with the Marathas and
the Nizam. He followed it up by an attack in the Carnatic,
capturing Arcot, and defeating the English army under

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  97

Colonel Baillie in 1781. In the meantime, the English (under
Sir Eyre Coote) detached both the Marathas and the Nizam
from Haidar’s side, but the undeterred Haidar faced the
English boldly only to suffer a defeat at Porto Novo in
November 1781. However, he regrouped his forces and
defeated the English and captured their commander,
Braithwaite.
Treaty of Mangalore Haidar Ali died of cancer on
December 7, 1782. Now his son, Tipu Sultan, carried on the
war for one year without any positive outcome. Fed up with
an inconclusive war, both sides opted for peace, negotiating
the Treaty of Mangalore (March, 1784) under which each
party gave back the territories it had taken from the other.

Third Anglo-Mysore War
Background
A dispute arose between Tipu and the state of Travancore.
Travancore had purchased Jalkottal and Cannanore from the
Dutch in the Cochin state. As Cochin was a feudatory of Tipu,
he considered the act of Travancore as a violation of his
sovereign rights. So, in April 1790, Tipu declared war against
Travancore for the restoration of his rights.
Course of War
The English, siding with Travancore, attacked Tipu. In 1790,
Tipu defeated the English under General Meadows. In 1791,
Cornwallis took the leadership and at the head of a large army
marched through Ambur and Vellore to Bangalore (captured
in March 1791) and from there to Seringapatam. Coimbatore
fell to them, but they lost it again, and at last with the support
of the Marathas and the Nizam, the English attacked
Seringapatam for the second time. Tipu offered serious
opposition, but the odds were against him. Consequently, he
had to pay heavily under the Treaty of Seringapatam.
Treaty of Seringapatam Under this treaty of 1792,
nearly half of the Mysorean territory was taken over by the
victors. Baramahal, Dindigul and Malabar went to the English,
while the Marathas got the regions surrounding the Tungabhadra
and its tributaries and the Nizam acquired the areas from the
Krishna to beyond the Pennar. Besides, a war damage of three

98

friends too formidable.
—Lord Cornwallis

crore rupees was also taken from Tipu. Half of the war
indemnity was to be paid immediately while the rest was to
be given in installments, for which Tipu’s two sons were taken
as hostages by the English.

Fourth Anglo-Mysore War
Background
The English as well as Tipu Sultan used the period 1792 to
1799 to recoup their losses. Tipu fulfilled all the terms of
the Treaty of Seringapatam and got his sons released. In 1796,
when the Hindu ruler of Wodeyar dynasty died, Tipu refused
to place Wodeyar’s minor son on the throne and declared
himself sultan. He also decided to avenge his humilitating
defeat and the terms put by the Treaty of Seringapatam.
In 1798, Lord Wellesley succeeded Sir John Shore as
the new Governor General. An imperialist to the core,
Wellesley was concerned about Tipu’s growing friendship
with the French and aimed at annihilating Tipu’s independent
existence or force him to submission through the system of
Subsidiary Alliance. So the chargesheet against Tipu mentioned
that he was plotting against the English with the Nizam and
the Marathas and that he had sent emissaries to Arabia,
Afghanistan, Kabul and Zaman Shah, as also to Isle of France
(Mauritius) and Versailles, with treasonable intent. Tipu’s
explanation did not satisfy Wellesley.
Course of War
The war began on April 17, 1799 and ended on May 4, 1799
with the fall of Seringapatam. Tipu was defeated first by
English General Stuart and then by General Harris. Arthur
Wellesley, the brother of Lord Wellesley, also participated
in the war. The English were again helped by the Marathas
and the Nizam. The Marathas had been promised half of the

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  99

Estimate of Tipu Sultan
Tipu Sultan was born in November 1750 to Haidar Ali and Fatima.
A well educated man, he could freely converse in Arabic, Persian,
Kanarese and Urdu.
Tipu was a great warrior (he was known as the ‘Tiger of
Mysore’) and gave maximum care to the raising and maintenance
of an efficient military force. He organised his army on the European
model with Persian words of command. Though he took the help
of the French officers to train his soldiers, he never allowed them
(French) to develop into a pressure group. Like his father, Tipu
realised the importance of a naval force. In 1796, he set up a Board
of Admiralty and planned for a fleet of 22 battleships and 20 large
frigates. Three dockyards were established at Mangalore, Wajedabad
and Molidabad. However, his plans did not fructify.
Tipu was a patron of science and technology. He is credited
as the ‘pioneer of rocket technology’ in India. He wrote a military
manual explaining the operation of rockets. He was also a pioneer
in introducing sericulture to the Mysore State.
Tipu was a great lover of democracy and a great diplomat.
He gave his support to the French soldiers at Seringapatam in setting
up a Jacobin Club in 1797. He ordered a salute of 2,300 cannons
and 500 rockets to celebrate the occasion. Tipu himself became
a member of the Jacobin Club and allowed himself to be called
Citizen Tipu. He planted the Tree of Liberty at Seringapatam.
Some historians have depicted Tipu as a bigoted monarch.
This was the main view of colonial historians. This estimation of
the sultan is not fully correct. It is true that he crushed the Hindu
Coorgs and Nairs. But at the same time he also punished the Muslim
Moplahs when they defied his authority. Though he is reported to
have demolished temples in Kerala when he conquered places there,
Tipu is also known to have protected Hindu temples within his own
kingdom. He sanctioned funds for the repair of the Sringeri Temple
and installation of the idol of Goddess Sarada (the idol had been
damaged during a Maratha raid in 1791). It is necessary not to
judge characters of the past with modern yardsticks of secularism
and democracy.
Tipu despised the use of palanquins and described them as
fit only for use of women and the disabled. He is also credited
with beginning capitalist development at a time when feudalism was
prevalent.
Tipu was a man representing multiple traditions.

100  

territory of Tipu and the Nizam had already signed the
Subsidiary Alliance. Tipu laid down his life fighting bravely;
his family members were interned at Vellore, and his
treasures were confiscated by the English. The English chose
a boy from the earlier Hindu royal family of Mysore as the
maharaja and also imposed on him the subsidiary alliance
system.

Mysore After Tipu

● Wellesley offered Soonda and Harponelly districts
of Mysore Kingdom to the Marathas, which the latter refused.
● The Nizam was given the districts of Gooty and
Gurramkonda.
● The English took possession of Kanara, Wynad,
Coimbatore, Dwaraporam and Seringapatam.
● The new state of Mysore was handed over to the old
Hindu dynasty (Wodeyars) under a minor ruler Krishnaraja
III, who accepted the subsidiary alliance.
● In 1831 William Bentinck took control of Mysore
on grounds of misgovernance.
● In 1881 Lord Ripon restored the kingdom to its ruler.

Views
Tipu has been regarded by some writers as the first Indian
nationalist and a martyr for India’s freedom. But this is a wrong
view arrived at by projecting the present into the past. In the
age in which Tipu lived and ruled there was no sense of
nationalism or an awareness among Indians that they were a
subject people. It will, therefore, be too much to say that Tipu
waged war against the English for the sake of India’s freedom.
Actually he fought in order to preserve his own power and
independence...
—Mohibbul Hasan, History of Tipu Sultan
When a person travelling through a strange country finds it well
cultivated, populous with industrious inhabitants, cities newly
founded, commerce extending, towns increasing and everything
flourishing so as to indicate happiness he will naturally conclude
it to be under a form of government congenial to the minds
of the people. This is a picture of Tippoo’s country.

Anglo-Maratha Struggle for
Supremacy
Rise of the Marathas

As the Mughal Empire declined, one of the staunchest and
hardiest of the empire’s adversaries, the Marathas, got a
chance to rise in power. They controlled a large portion of
the country; besides, they also received tributes from areas
not directly under their control. By the middle of the
eighteenth century, they were in Lahore thinking of becoming
rulers of the north Indian empire and in the court of the
Mughals playing the role of kingmakers.
Though the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), in which
they were defeated by Ahmad Shah Abdali, changed the
situation, they regrouped, regained their strength and within
a decade achieved a position of power in India.
Bajirao I (1720-40), considered greatest of all the
Peshwas, had started a confederacy of prominent Maratha
chiefs to manage the rapidly expanding Maratha power, and
to some extent appease the kshatriya section of the Marathas
(Peshwas were brahmins) led by the senapati Dabodi. Under
the arrangement of the Maratha confederacy, each prominent
family under a chief was assigned a sphere of influence which
he was supposed to conquer and rule, but in the name of
the then Maratha king, Shahu. The Maratha families which
emerged prominent were—(i) the Gaekwad of Baroda,
(ii) the Bhonsle of Nagpur, (iii) the Holkars of Indore,
(iv) the Sindhias of Gwalior, and (v) the Peshwa of Poona.
The confederacy, under Bajirao I to Madhavrao I worked
cordially but the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) changed
everything. The defeat at Panipat and later the death of the
young Peshwa, Madhavrao I, in 1772, weakened the control
of the Peshwas over the confederacy. Though the chiefs of
the confederacy united on occasion, as against the British
(1775-82), more often they quarrelled among themselves.

Entry of the English into Maratha Politics

The years between the last quarter of the 18th century and
the first quarter of the 19th century witnessed the Marathas

102  

and the English clashing thrice for political supremacy, with
the English emerging victorious in the end. The cause of
these conflicts was the inordinate ambition of the English,
and the divided house of the Marathas that encouraged the
English to hope for success in their venture. The English in
Bombay wanted to establish a government on the lines of
the arrangement made by Clive in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.
So it was a longed-for opportunity for the English when
dissensions over a succession divided the Marathas.

First Anglo-Maratha War (1775-82)
Background
After the death of Madhavrao in 1772, his brother Narayanrao
succeeded him as the fifth peshwa. However, Narayanrao’s
uncle, Raghunathrao, had his nephew assassinated and named
himself as the next peshwa, although he was not a legal heir.
Narayanrao’s widow, Gangabai, gave birth to a son after her
husband’s death. The newborn infant was named ‘Sawai’ (One
and a Quarter) Madhavrao and he was legally the next peshwa.
Twelve Maratha chiefs (Barabhai), led by Nana Phadnavis,
made an effort to name the infant as the new peshwa and
rule for him as regents.
Treaties of Surat and Purandhar Raghunathrao,
unwilling to give up his position in power, sought help from
the English at Bombay and signed the Treaty of Surat in
1775. Under the treaty, Raghunathrao ceded the territories
of Salsette and Bassein to the English along with a portion
of the revenues from Surat and Bharuch districts. In return,
the English were to provide Raghunathrao with 2,500 soldiers.
The British Calcutta Council, on the other side of India,
condemned the Treaty of Surat (1775) and sent Colonel
Upton to Pune to annul it and make a new treaty (Treaty
of Purandhar, 1776) with the regency renouncing Raghunath
and promising him a pension. The Bombay government
rejected this and gave refuge to Raghunath. In 1777, Nana
Phadnavis violated his treaty with the Calcutta Council by
granting the French a port on the west coast. The English
retaliated by sending a force towards Pune.

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  103

Course of War
The English and the Maratha armies met on the outskirts of
Pune. Though the Maratha army had a larger number of
soldiers than the English, the latter had highly superior
ammunition and cannons. However, the Maratha army was
commanded by a brilliant general named Mahadji Sindhia
(also known as Mahadji Shinde). Mahadji lured the English
army into the ghats (mountain passes) near Talegaon and
trapped the English from all sides and attacked the English
supply base at Khopali. The Marathas also utilised a scorched
earth policy, burning farmland and poisoning wells. As the
English began to withdraw to Talegaon, the Marathas attacked,
forcing them to retreat to the village of Wadgaon. Here, the
English army was surrounded on all sides by the Marathas
and cut off from food and water supplies. The English
surrendered by mid-January 1779 and signed the Treaty of
Wadgaon that forced the Bombay government to relinquish
all territories acquired by the English since 1775.
Treaty of Salbai (1782): End of the First Phase of
the Struggle Warren Hastings, the Governor-General in
Bengal, rejected the Treaty of Wadgaon and sent a large force
of soldiers under Colonel Goddard who captured Ahmedabad
in February 1779, and Bassein in December 1780. Another
Bengal detachment led by Captain Popham captured Gwalior
in August 1780. In February 1781 the English, under General
Camac, finally defeated Sindhia at Sipri.
Sindhia proposed a new treaty between the Peshwa and
the English, and the Treaty of Salbai was signed in May 1782;
it was ratified by Hastings in June 1782 and by Phadnavis
in February 1783. The treaty guaranteed peace between the
two sides for twenty years. The main provisions of the Treaty
of Salbai were:
(i) Salsette should continue in the possession of the
English.
(ii) The whole of the territory conquered since the
Treaty of Purandhar (1776) including Bassein should be
restored to the Marathas.
(iii) In Gujarat, Fateh Singh Gaekwad should remain in
possession of the territory which he had before the war and
should serve the Peshwa as before.

104  

(iv) The English should not offer any further support
to Raghunathrao and the Peshwa should grant him a
maintenance allowance.
(v) Haidar Ali should return all the territory taken from
the English and the Nawab of Arcot.
(vi) The English should enjoy the privileges at trade
as before.
(vii) The Peshwa should not support any other European
nation.
(viii) The Peshwa and the English should undertake that
their several allies should remain at peace with one another.
(ix) Mahadji Sindhia should be the mutual guarantor for
the proper observance of the terms of the treaty.

Second Anglo Maratha War (1803-1805)
Background
The Second Anglo-Maratha war started in circumstances
similar to those of the first. After Peshwa Madhavrao Narayan
committed suicide in 1795, Bajirao II, the worthless son of
Raghunathrao, became the Peshwa. Nana Phadnavis, a bitter
foe of Bajirao II, became the chief minister. The dissensions
among the Marathas provided the English with an opportunity
to intervene in Maratha affairs. The death of Nana Phadnavis
in 1800 gave the British an added advantage.
Course of War
On April 1, 1801 the Peshwa brutally murdered the brother
of Jaswantrao (also called Yashwantrao by some historians)
Holkar, Vithuji. A furious Jaswant arrayed his forces against
the combined armies of Sindhia and Bajirao II. The turmoil
continued and on October 25, 1802, Jaswant defeated the
armies of the Peshwa and Sindhia decisively at Hadapsar near
Poona and placed Vinayakrao, son of Amritrao, on the
Peshwa’s seat. A terrified Bajirao II fled to Bassein where,
on December 31, 1802, he signed a treaty with the English.
Treaty of Bassein (1802) Under the treaty, the Peshwa
agreed:
(i) to receive from the Company a native infantry
(consisting of not less than 6,000 troops), with the usual
proportion of field artillery and European artillery men
attached, to be permanently stationed in his territories;

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  105

(ii) to cede to the Company territories yielding an
income of Rs 26 lakh;
(iii) to surrender the city of Surat;
(iv) to give up all claims for chauth on the Nizam’s
dominions;
(v) to accept the Company’s arbitration in all differences
between him and the Nizam or the Gaekwad;
(vi) not to keep in his employment Europeans of any
nation at war with the English; and
(vii) to subject his relations with other states to the
control of the English.
Reduced to Vassalage After the Peshwa accepted the
subsidiary alliance, Sindhia and Bhonsle attempted to save
Maratha independence. But the well prepared and organised
army of the English under Arthur Wellesley defeated the
combined armies of Sindhia and Bhonsle and forced them
to conclude separate subsidiary treaties with the English.
In 1804, Jashwantrao Holkar made an attempt to form
a coalition of Indian rulers to fight against the English. But
his attempt proved unsuccessful. The Marathas were defeated,
reduced to British vassalage and isolated from one another.
[(i) Defeat of Bhonsle (December 17, 1803, Treaty of
Devgaon); (ii) Defeat of Sindhia (December 30, 1803,
Treaty of Surajianjangaon); and (iii) Defeat of Holkar
(1806, Treaty of Rajpurghat)].
Significance of the Treaty of Bassein Admittedly, the
treaty was signed by a Peshwa who lacked political authority,
but the gains made by the English were immense. The
provision of keeping English troops permanently in Maratha
territory was of great strategical benefit. The Company
already had troops in Mysore, Hyderabad and Lucknow. The
addition of Poona on the list meant that the Company’s troops
were now more evenly spread and could be rushed to any
place without much delay in times of need. Though the Treaty
of Bassein did not hand over India to the Company on a
platter, it was a major development in that direction; the
Company was now well placed to expand its areas of
influence. In the circumstances, the observation that the
treaty “gave the English the key to India,” may be exaggerated,
but appears understandable.

106  

Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-19)
Background
Lord Hastings had the imperialistic design of imposing
British paramountcy. By the Charter Act of 1813, the East
India Company’s monopoly of trade in China (except tea)
ended and hence the company needed more markets.
The Pindaris, made up of many castes and classes, were
attached to Maratha armies as mercenaries. When the Marathas
became weak, the Pindaris could not get regular employment.
As a consequence, they started plundering neighbouring
territories, including those of the Company. The English
charged the Marathas with giving shelter to the Pindaris.
Pindari leaders like Amir Khan and Karim Khan surrendered
while Chitu Khan fled into the jungles.
The Treaty of Bassein, described as “a treaty with a
cipher (the Peshwa)”, wounded the feelings of the other
Maratha leaders. They saw the treaty as an absolute surrender
of independence.
Lord Hastings’ actions taken against the Pindaris were
seen as a transgression of the sovereignty of the Marathas;
they served to once again unite the Maratha confederacy. A
repentant Bajirao II made a last bid in 1817 by rallying
together the Maratha chiefs against the English in course of
the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
Course of War
The Peshwa attacked the British Residency at Poona. Appa
Sahib of Nagpur attacked the residency at Nagpur, and the
Holkar made preparations for war. But by then the Marathas
had lost almost all those elements which are needed for the
growth of a power. The political and administrative conditions
of all the Maratha states were confused and inefficient. After
the death of Jaswantrao Holkar, Tulsi Bai, the Holkar’s
favourite mistress, came to the helm of affairs in Poona.
Though a clever and intelligent woman, she could not
administer the state properly because she was influenced by
some unworthy men such as Balram Seth and Amir Khan.
The Bhonsle at Nagpur and the Sindhia at Gwalior had also
become weak. So the English, striking back vigorously,

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  107

succeeded in not allowing the Peshwa to exert his authority
again on the Maratha confederacy.
Result The Peshwa was defeated at Khirki, Bhonsle at
Sitabuldi, and Holkar at Mahidpur.
Some important treaties were signed. These were:
● June 1817, Treaty of Poona, with Peshwa.
● November 1817, Treaty of Gwalior, with Sindhia.
● January 1818, Treaty of Mandasor, with Holkar.
In June 1818, the Peshwa finally surrendered and the
Maratha confederacy was dissolved. The peshwaship was
abolished. Peshwa Bajirao became a British retainer at Bithur
near Kanpur. Pratap Singh, a lineal descendant of Shivaji, was
made ruler of a small principality, Satara, formed out of the
Peshwa’s dominions.

Why the Marathas Lost

There were several reasons for the Marathas’ defeat by the
English. The main reasons were as follows.
(i) Inept Leadership The Maratha state was despotic
in character. The personality and character of the head of
the state had a great bearing on the affairs of the state. But,
unfortunately, the later Maratha leaders Bajirao II, Daulatrao
Sindhia and Jaswantrao Holkar were worthless and selfish
leaders. They were no match for the English officials such
as Elphinstone, John Malcolm and Arthur Wellesley (who
later led the English to conquer Napoleon).
(ii) Defective Nature of Maratha State The cohesion
of the people of the Maratha state was not organic but
artificial and accidental, and hence precarious. There was no
effort, right from the days of Shivaji, for a well thought out
organised communal improvement, spread of education or
unification of the people. The rise of the Maratha state was
based on the religio-national movement. This defect of the
Maratha state became glaring when they had to contend with
a European power organised on the best pattern of the West.
(iii) Loose Political Set-up The Maratha empire was
a loose confederation under the leadership of the Chhatrapati
and later the Peshwa. Powerful chiefs such as the Gaikwad,
the Holkar, the Sindhia and the Bhonsle carved out semiindependent kingdoms for themselves and paid lip service to

108  

the authority of the Peshwa. Further, there existed
irreconcilable hostility between different units of the
confederacy. The Maratha chief often took sides with one
or the other. The lack of a cooperative spirit among the
Maratha chiefs proved detrimental to the Maratha state.
(iv) Inferior Military System Though full of personal
prowess and valour, the Marathas were inferior to the English
in organisation of the forces, in war weapons, in disciplined
action and in effective leadership. The centrifugal tendencies
of divided command accounted for much of the Maratha
failures. Treachery in the ranks was instrumental in weakening
the Maratha forces. The adoption of the modern techniques
of warfare by the Marathas was inadequate. The Marathas
neglected the paramount importance of artillery. Though the
Poona government set up an artillery department, it hardly
functioned effectively.
(v) Unstable Economic Policy The Maratha leadership
failed to evolve a stable economic policy to suit the changing
needs of time. There were no industries or foreign trade
openings. So, the economy of the Maratha was not conducive
to a stable political set-up.
(vi) Superior English Diplomacy and Espionage The
English had better diplomatic skill to win allies and isolate
the enemy. The disunity among the Maratha chiefs simplified
the task of the English. Diplomatic superiority enabled the
English to take a quick offensive against the target.
Unlike the Marathas’ ignorance and lack of information
about their enemy, the English maintained a well-knit spy
system to gather knowledge of the potentialities, strengths,
weaknesses and military methods of their foes.
(vii) Progressive English Outlook The English were
rejuvenated by the forces of Renaissance, emancipating them
from the shackles of the Church. They were devoting their
energies to scientific inventions, extensive ocean voyages and
acquisition of colonies. Indians, on the other hand, were still
steeped in medievalism marked by old dogmas and notions.
The Maratha leaders paid very little attention to mundane
matters of the state. Insistence on maintenance of traditional
social hierarchy based on the dominance of the priestly class
made the union of an empire difficult.

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  109

In the end, it can be concluded that the English attacked
a ‘divided house’ which started crumbling after a few pushes.

Conquest of Sindh
In the early 19th century, the English started to show an
interest in Sindh where they enjoyed some trade facilities
authorised by a farman of the Mughal Emperor in 1630. The
farman provided the English with such privileges in the ports
of Sindh which they enjoyed elsewhere.

Rise of Talpuras Amirs

In the eighteenth century, prior to the rule of Talpuras Amirs,
Sindh was ruled by the Kallora chiefs. In 1758, an English
factory was built at Thatta, owing to a parwana given by the
Kallora prince, Ghulam Shah. In 1761, Ghulam Shah, on the
arrival of an English resident in his court, not only ratified
the earlier treaty, but also excluded other Europeans from
trading there. This advantage was enjoyed by the English upto
1775 when a not-too-friendly ruler, Sarfraz Khan, made the
English close their factory.
In the 1770s, a Baluch tribe called Talpuras, descended
from the hills and settled in the plains of Sindh. They were
excellent soldiers as well as adapted to hard life. They
acquired great influence and soon usurped power in the new
region. In 1783, the Talpuras, under the leadership of Mir
Fath (Fatah) Ali Khan, established complete hold over Sindh
and sent the Kallora prince into exile. The then Durrani
monarch confirmed the claims of Mir Fath Khan and ordered
the latter to share the country with his brothers (Mir’s
brothers, popularly known as ‘Char Yar’). When Mir Fath
died in 1800, the Char Yar divided the kingdom among
themselves, calling themselves the Amirs or Lords of Sindh.
These amirs extended their dominion on all sides. They
conquered Amarkot from the Raja of Jodhpur, Karachi from
the chief of Luz, Shaikarpur and Bukkar from the Afghans.

Gradual Ascendancy over Sindh

A common belief in the late 18th century was that Napoleon
was conspiring with Tipu Sultan to invade India. In 1799
behind Lord Wellesley’s efforts to revive commercial relations

110  

with Sindh was the hidden aim to counteract the alliance of
the French, Tipu Sultan and Shah Zaman, the Kabul monarch.
Negotiations were opened with Fath Ali Khan. But under the
influence of Tipu Sultan and the jealousy of the local traders,
aided by the anti-British party at Hyderabad (Sindh), the amir
in October 1800, ordered the British agent to quit Sindh
within ten days. The British agent (Crow) left Sindh and the
Company quietly suffered the insult.
Treaty of ‘Eternal Friendship’
In June 1807, the alliance of Tilsit with Alexander I of Russia
was joined by Napoleon Bonaparte. The alliance had as one
of its conditions a combined invasion of India by the land
route. Now the British wanted to create a barrier between
Russia and British India. To achieve this, Lord Minto sent
three delegations under the leadership of various prominent
persons to forge alliances. Accordingly, Metcalfe was sent
to Lahore, Elphinstone to Kabul and Malcolm to Teheran.
Sindh was visited by Nicholas Smith who met the Amirs to
conclude a defensive arrangement. After negotiations, the
Amirs agreed to a treaty—their first-ever treaty with the
English. After professing eternal friendship, both sides
agreed to exclude the French from Sindh and to exchange
agents at each other’s court. The treaty was renewed in 1820
with the addition of an article excluding the Americans and
resolving some border disputes on the side of Kachch after
the final defeat of the Maratha confederacy in 1818.
Treaty of 1832
In 1832, William Bentinck sent Colonel Pottinger to Sindh
to sign a treaty with the Amirs. The provisions of the treaty
were as follows:
(i) Free passage through Sindh would be allowed to the
English traders and travellers and the use of Indus for trading
purposes; however, no warships would ply, nor any materials
for war would be carried.
(ii) No English merchant would settle down in Sindh,
and passports would be needed for travellers.
(iii) Tariff rates could be altered by the Amirs if found
high and no military dues or tolls would be demanded.

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  111

(iv) The Amirs would work with the Raja of Jodhpur
to put down the robbers of Kachch.
(v) The old treaties were confirmed and the parties
would not be jealous of each other.
Lord Auckland and Sindh
Lord Auckland, who became the Governor-General in 1836,
looked at Sindh from the perspective of saving India from
a possible Russian invasion and wished to obtain a counteracting
influence over the Afghans. Ranjit Singh in Punjab was strong
enough to resist coercion in this regard, but the Amirs were
not. Thus the English view was that they had to consolidate
their position in Sindh as a necessary first step for their plans
on Afghanistan. They got an opportunity when Ranjit Singh
captured a frontier town of Sindh, Rojhan, and Pottinger was
sent to Hyderabad to sign a new treaty with the Amirs. The
treaty offered protection to the Amirs on the condition that
the Company troops would be kept in the capital at the
Amir’s expense or alternatively the English would be given
suitable concessions in return. The Amirs initially refused
but later agreed reluctantly to sign the treaty in 1838 when
the possibility of Ranjit Singh getting help from others was
pointed out to them. The treaty permitted the English to
intervene in the disputes between the Amirs and the Sikhs
as also to establish the presence of a British resident who
could go anywhere he liked escorted by English troops. Thus
Sindh was turned into a British protectorate in 1838.
Tripartite Treaty of 1838 To address the Afghan
problem (as the British imagined it) the Company resorted
to further duplicity. Firstly, they persuaded Ranjit Singh to
sign a tripartite treaty in June 1838 agreeing to British
mediation in his disputes with the Amirs, and then made

India had fallen to a lower level of unscrupulousness than ever
before and the plain fact is that the treatment of Sindh from
this time onward, however expedient politically, was morally
indefensible.

Emperor Shah Shuja give up his sovereign rights on Sindh,
provided the arrears of tribute were paid. The exact amount
of the tribute was to be determined by the English whose
main objective was to obtain finances for the Afghan
adventure and obtain so much of the Amirs’ territory as would
secure a line of operation against Afghanistan through Sindh.
Sindh Accepts Subsidiary Alliance (1839) The
Company intended to persuade or compel the Amirs to pay
the money and also to consent to the abrogation of that article
in the treaty of 1832 which prohibited the movement of
English troops in Sindh by land or by river. B.L. Grover
writes: “Under threat of superior force, the Amirs accepted
a treaty in February 1839 by which a British subsidiary force
had to be stationed at Shikarpur and Bukkar and the Amirs
of Sindh were to pay Rs 3 lakh annually for the maintenance
of the Company’s troops”. Henceforth, the Amirs were
debarred from having any negotiations with foreign states
without the knowledge of the Company. Further, they were
to provide store-room at Karachi for the Company’s military
supplies, besides abolishing all tolls on the Indus, and
furnishing an auxiliary force for the Afghan war if called upon
to do so.
Capitulation of Sindh The first Anglo-Afghan War
(1839-42), fought on the soil of Sindh, was never liked by
the Amirs of Sindh; neither did they like the presence of
the British troops in their region. However, under the treaty
they were asked to pay for all this, which they did. They were
not rewarded or thanked for their services, but were charged
with hostility and disaffection against the British government.
The Amirs were charged with treasonable activities against
the British, and Ellenborough, placed in a precarious position
due to the Afghan war reverses, sent Outram to Sindh to
negotiate a new treaty. Under this treaty, the Amirs were
required to cede important provinces as the price of their
past transgressions, to supply fuel to the Company’s steamers
plying on the Indus, and to stop minting coins. Furthermore,
in a succession dispute, the English intervened through
Napier, and started a war when the Amirs rose in revolt. The
whole of Sindh capitulated within a short time, and the Amirs

were made captives and banished from Sindh. In 1843, under
Governor-General Ellenborough, Sindh was merged into the
British Empire and Charles Napier was appointed its first
governor.

Criticisms of the Conquest of Sindh

Historians generally condemn the acquisition of Sindh by the
British in strong words. The causes for annexation were
deliberately manufactured. Like many episodes in the British
conquest of India, the Afghan war is also a tale of bullying
tactics and deceit. However, in the instance of the First
Afghan War, the English suffered terribly at the hands of the
Afghans with a corresponding loss of prestige. To compensate
for this, they annexed Sindh which prompted Elphinstone to
comment: “Coming from Afghanistan it put one in mind of
a bully who has been knocked in the street and went home
to beat his wife in revenge.”

Conquest of Punjab
Consolidation of Punjab under the Sikhs

After the murder of the last Sikh guru, Guru Govind Singh,
a section of Sikhs under the leadership of Banda Bahadur
revolted against the Mughals during the rule of Bahadur Shah.
In 1715, Banda Bahadur was defeated by Farrukhsiyar and put
to death in 1716. Thus the Shikh polity, once again, became

114  

leaderless and later got divided into two groups—Bandai
(liberal) and Tat Khalsa (Orthodox). This rift among the
followers ended in 1721 under the influence of Bhai Mani
Singh. Later in 1784 Kapur Singh Faizullapuria organised the
Sikhs under Dal Khalsa, with the objective of uniting
followers of Sikhism, politically, culturally and economically.
The whole body of the Khalsa was formed into two sections—
Budha Dal, the army of the veterans, and Taruna Dal, the
army of the young.
The weakness of the Mughals and invasions of Ahmad
Shah Abdali created a general confusion and anarchy in
Punjab. These political conditions helped the organised Dal
Khalsa to consolidate further. The Sikhs consolidated in
misls which were military brotherhoods with a democratic
set-up. Misl is an Arabic word which means equal or alike.
Another meaning of Misl is State. During the period, 1763
to 1773, many misls started to rule the Punjab region under
Sikh chieftains, from Saharanpur in the east to Attock in the
west, from the mountaineous regions of the north to Multan
in the south.
Sukarchakiya Misl and Ranjit Singh
At the time of the birth of Ranjit Singh (November 2, 1780),
there were 12 important misls—Ahluwaliya, Bhangi,
Dallewalia, Faizullapuria, Kanhaiya, Krorasinghia, Nakkai,
Nishaniya, Phulakiya, Ramgarhiya Sukharchakiya, and
Shaheed. The central administration of a misl was based on
Gurumatta Sangh which was essentially a political, social
and economic system. Ranjit Singh was the son of Mahan
Singh, the leader of the Sukarchakiya misl. Mahan Singh died
when Ranjit Singh was only 12 years old. But Ranjit Singh
showed an early acumen at political affairs. Towards the close
of the 18th century, all the important misls (except
Sukarchakiya) were in a state of disintegration. Afghanistan
was also engulfed in a civil war due to a power struggle which
went on for the next three decades. These events in the
neighbouring regions were fully exploited by Ranjit Singh
who followed a ruthless policy of ‘blood and iron’ and carved
out for himself a kingdom in the central Punjab. In 1799,
Ranjit Singh was appointed as the governor of Lahore by

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  115

Zaman Shah, the ruler of Afghanistan. In 1805, Ranjit Singh
acquired Jammu and Amritsar and thus the political capital
(Lahore) and religious capital (Amritsar) of Punjab came
under the rule of Ranjit Singh. He also maintained good
relations with the Dogras and the Nepalese and enlisted them
in his army.

Ranjit Singh and the English

The prospects of a joint Franco-Russian invasion of India
through the land-route had alarmed the English. In 1807, Lord
Minto sent Charles Metcalfe to Lahore. Ranjit Singh offered
to accept Metcalfe’s proposal of an offensive and defensive
alliance on the condition that the English would remain
neutral in case of a Sikh-Afghan war and would consider
Ranjit Singh the sovereign of the entire Punjab including the
Malwa (cis-Sutlej) territories. However, the negotiations
failed. In the changed political scenario in which the
Napoleonic danger receded and the English became more
assertive, Ranjit Singh agreed to sign the Treaty of Amritsar
(April 25, 1809) with the Company.
Treaty of Amritsar
The Treaty of Amritsar was significant for its immediate as
well as potential effects. It checked one of the most
cherished ambitions of Ranjit Singh to extend his rule over
the entire Sikh nation by accepting the river Sutlej as the
boundary line for his dominions and the Company’s. Now
he directed his energies towards the west and captured Multan
(1818), Kashmir (1819) and Peshawar (1834).
In June 1838, Ranjit Singh was compelled by political
compulsions to sign the Tripartite Treaty with the English;
however he refused to give passage to the British army
through his territories to attack Dost Mohammad, the Afghan
Amir.
The relations of Raja Ranjit Singh with the Company,
from 1809 to 1839, clearly indicate the former’s weak
position. Although he was conscious of his weak position,
he took no step to organise a coalition of other Indian princes
or maintain a balance of power. Ranjit Singh died in June
1839 and with his death the process of the decline of his
empire began.

Punjab After Ranjit Singh
Beginning of Court Factions
Ranjit Singh’s only legitimate son and successor, Kharak
Singh, was not efficient, and during the brief period of his
reign, court factions became active. Kharak Singh’s sudden
death in 1839 and the accidental death of his son, Prince
Nav Nihal Singh (when he was returning from his father’s
funeral), led to an anarchic situation in Punjab. Plans and
counter plans of various groups to capture the throne of
Lahore provided an opportunity for decisive action by the
English. The army—the pillar of the Sikh state—was far less
strong than it appeared to be. Ranjit Singh’s able generals—
Mohkam Chand, Dewan Chand, Hari Singh Nalwa, and Ram
Dayal—were already dead. Already discontent was growing
among the troops as a result of irregularity of payment. The
appointment of unworthy officers led to indiscipline. The
Lahore government, continuing the policy of friendship with
the English company, permitted the British troops to pass
through its territory—once, when they were fleeing from
Afghanistan, and again, when they were marching back to
Afghanistan to avenge their defeat. These marches resulted
in commotion and economic dislocation in Punjab.
Rani Jindal and Daleep Singh
After the death of Nav Nihal Singh, Sher Singh, another son
of Ranjit Singh succeeded, but he was murdered in late 1843.
Soon afterwards, Daleep Singh, a minor son of Ranjit Singh,
was proclaimed the Maharaja with Rani Jindan as regent and
Hira Singh Dogra as wazir. Hira Singh himself fell a victim
to a court intrigue and was murdered in 1844. The new wazir,
Jawahar Singh, the brother of Rani Jindan, soon incurred the
displeasure of the army and was deposed and put to death
in 1845. Lal Singh, a lover of Rani Jindan, won over the army
to his side and became the wazir in the same year, and Teja
Singh was appointed as the commander of the forces.

First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-46)
Causes
The outbreak of the first of the Anglo-Sikh wars has been
attributed to the action of the Sikh army crossing the River

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  117

Sutlej on December 11, 1845. This was seen as an aggressive
manoeuvre that provided the English with the justification to
declare war. The causes were, however, much more complex
and may be listed as follows:
(i) the anarchy in the Lahore kingdom following the
death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh resulting in a power
struggle for domination between the court at Lahore
and the ever powerful and increasingly local army;
(ii) suspicions amongst the Sikh army arising from
English military campaigns to achieve the annexation
of Gwalior and Sindh in 1841 and the campaign in
Afghanistan in 1842; and
(iii) the increase in the number of English troops being
stationed near the border with the Lahore kingdom.
Course of War
The war began in December 1845 with 20,000 to 30,000
troops in the British side, while the Sikhs had about 50,000
men under the overall command of Lal Singh. But the
treachery of Lal Singh and Teja Singh caused five successive
defeats to the Sikhs at Mudki (December 18, 1845),
Ferozeshah (December 21-22, 1845), Buddelwal, Aliwal
(January 28, 1846), and at Sobraon (February 10, 1846).
Lahore fell to the British forces on February 20, 1846
without a fight.
Treaty of Lahore (March 8, 1846) The end of the
first Anglo-Sikh War forced the Sikhs to sign a humiliating
treaty on March 8, 1846. The main features of the Treaty
of Lahore were as follows:
● War indemnity of more than 1 crore of rupees was
to be given to the English.
● The Jalandhar Doab (between the Beas and the Sutlej)
was annexed to the Company’s dominions.
● A British resident was to be established at Lahore
under Henry Lawrence.
● The strength of the Sikh army was reduced.
● Daleep Singh was recognised as the ruler under Rani
Jindan as regent and Lal Singh as wazir.
● Since, the Sikhs were not able to pay the entire war
indemnity, Kashmir including Jammu was sold to Gulab Singh

118  

and he was required to pay Rupees 75 lakh to the Company
as the price. The transfer of Kashmir to Gulab Singh was
formalised by a separate treaty on March 16, 1846.
Treaty of Bhairowal The Sikhs were not satisfied with
the Treaty of Lahore over the issue of Kashmir, so they
rebelled. In December, 1846, the Treaty of Bhairowal was
signed. According to the provisions of this treaty, Rani Jindan
was removed as regent and a council of regency for Punjab
was set up. The council consisted of 8 Sikh sardars presided
over by the English Resident, Henry Lawrence.

Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-49)
Causes
The defeat in the first Anglo-Sikh War and the provisions
of the treaties of Lahore and Bhairowal were highly humiliating
for the Sikhs. Inhuman treatment meted out to Rani Jindan,
who was sent to Benares as a pensioner, added to the
resentment of the Sikhs.
Mulraj, the governor of Multan, was replaced by a new
Sikh governor over the issue of increase in annual revenue.
Mulraj revolted and murdered two English officers
accompanying the new governor. Sher Singh was sent to
suppress the revolt, but he himself joined Mulraj, leading to
a mass uprising in Multan. This could be considered as the
immediate cause of the war. The then Governor-General of
India, Lord Dalhousie, a hardcore expansionist, got the
pretext to annex Punjab completely.
Course of War
Lord Dalhousie himself proceeded to Punjab. Three important
battles were fought before the final annexation of Punjab.
These three battles were:
(i) Battle of Ramnagar, led by Sir Hugh Gough, the
commander-in-chief of the Company.
(ii) Battle of Chillhanwala, January, 1849.
(iii) Battle of Gujarat, February 21, 1849; the Sikh army
surrendered at Rawalpindi, and their Afghan allies were
chased out of India. (Gujarat is a small town on the banks
of River Jhelum.)

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  119

Result At the end of the war came:
● surrender of the Sikh army and Sher Singh in 1849;
● annexation of Punjab; and for his services the Earl
of Dalhousie was given the thanks of the British
Parliament and a promotion in the peerage, as
Marquess;
● setting up of a three-member board to govern Punjab,
comprising of the Lawrence brothers (Henry and
John) and Charles Mansel.
In 1853 the board was nullified and Punjab was placed
under a chief commissioner. John Lawrence became the first
chief commissioner.

Significance of the Anglo-Sikh Wars

The Anglo-Sikh wars gave the two sides a mutual respect for
each other’s fighting prowess. The Sikhs were to fight loyally
on the British side in the Revolt of 1857 and in many other
campaigns and wars uptil the Indian independence in 1947.

Extension of British
Paramountcy Through
Administrative Policy
The process of imperial expansion and consolidation of
British paramountcy was carried on by the Company during
the 1757-1857 period through a two-fold method: (a) policy
of annexation by conquest or war; and (b) policy of annexation
by diplomacy and administrative mechanisms. We have
already discussed how the Company defeated and subjugated,
one by one, the major Indian powers like Bengal, Mysore,
the Marathas and the Sikhs, mainly by waging wars against
them and through considerable deceit. But in the case of
many other powers, the British applied diplomatic and
administrative policies. In this context, we may cite examples
of Warren Hastings’ ‘ring-fence’ policy, Wellesley’s system
of ‘subsidiary alliance’ and Dalhousie’s ‘doctrine of lapse’
to see how the British dominion expanded in India.

The Policy of Ring-Fence

Warren Hastings took charge as the governor-general at a
critical period of British rule when the British were to

120  

encounter the powerful combination of the Marathas, Mysore
and Hyderabad. He followed a policy of ring-fence which
aimed at creating buffer zones to defend the Company’s
frontiers. Broadly speaking, it was the policy of defence of
their neighbours’ frontiers for safeguarding their own
territories. This policy of Warren Hastings was reflected in
his war against the Marathas and Mysore. The chief danger
to the Company’s territories was from the Afghan invaders
and the Marathas. To safeguard against these dangers, the
Company undertook to organise the defence of the frontiers
of Awadh on the condition that the Nawab would defray the
expenses of the defending army. The defence of Awadh
constituted the defence of Bengal during that time. Thus the
states brought under the ring-fence system were assured of
military assistance against external aggression—but at their
own expense. In other words, these allies were required to
maintain subsidiary forces which were to be organised,
equipped and commanded by the officers of the Company
who, in turn, were to be paid by the rulers of these states.
Wellesley’s policy of subsidiary alliance was, in fact,
an extension of the ring-fence system which sought to reduce
the Indian states into a position of dependence on the British
government.

Subsidiary Alliance

The subsidiary alliance system was used by Lord Wellesley,
who was governor-general from 1798-1805, to build an
empire in India. Under the system, the allying Indian state’s
ruler was compelled to accept the permanent stationing of
a British force within his territory and to pay a subsidy for
its maintenance. The Indian ruler had to agree to the posting
of a British resident in his court. The Indian ruler could not
employ any European in his service without the prior
consultation with the Company. Nor could he go to war or
negotiate with any other Indian ruler without consulting the
governor-general. In return for all this, the British would
defend the ruler from his enemies and adopt a policy of noninterference in the internal matters of the allied state.
One of the objectives behind Wellesley’s strengthening

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  121

of the subsidiary alliance system was to keep the French from
reviving and expanding their influence in India. Around this
time, the fear of Napoleon’s expedition towards the East was
very real for the British who felt that the French could attack
the western coast of India from their colony of Mauritius.
Hence the clause in the alliance treaty requiring the Indian
rulers to dismiss Europeans (other than the British) from
their service and not employ any. By means of this system,
the Company could station its forces at strategic locations
and keep the French at bay. Besides, the subsidiary alliance
would expand the Company’s hold over the Indian states and
gradually bring more and more territory into the Company’s
fold.
The Indian rulers lost their independence by buying
security. They were not free of interference from the British
Resident. They lost much of their revenue, paying for the
British troops. Also, the alliance made the Indian rulers weak
and irresponsible; the subjects were exploited and it was
practically impossible to depose the oppressive rulers as they
were protected by the British.
Evolution and Perfection
It was probably Dupleix, who first gave on hire (so to say)
European troops to Indian rulers to fight their wars. Since
then, almost all the governor-generals from Clive onwards
applied the system to various Indian states and brought it to
near perfection.
The first Indian state to fall into this protection trap
(which anticipated the subsidiary alliance system) was Awadh
which in 1765 signed a treaty under which the Company
pledged to defend the frontiers of Awadh on the condition
of the Nawab defraying the expenses of such defence. It was
in 1787 that the Company first insisted that the subsidiary
state should not have foreign relations. This was included in
the treaty with the Nawab of Carnatic which Cornwallis
signed in February 1787. It was Wellesley’s genius to make
it a general rule to negotiate for the surrender of territory
in full sovereignty for the maintenance of the subsidiary
force.

122  

Stages of Application of Subsidiary Alliance
There were four stages in the evolution of the subsidiary
alliance. In the first stage, the Company offered to help a
friendly Indian state with its troops to fight any war the state
might be engaged in. The second stage consisted of making
a common cause with the Indian state now made friendly and
taking the field with its own soldiers and those of the state.
Now came the third stage when the Indian ally was asked
not for men but for money. In return, the Company promised
that it would recruit, train, and maintain a fixed number of
soldiers under British officers, and that the contingent would
be available to the ruler for his personal protection as also
for keeping out aggressors. In the fourth or the last stage,
the money or the protection fee was fixed, usually at a high
level; when the state failed to pay the money in time, it was
asked to cede certain parts of its territories to the Company
in lieu of payment.
The Company’s entry into the affairs of the state had
begun; now it would be for the British resident (installed in
the state capital under the treaty) to initiate, sustain and
hasten the process of eventual annexation.
View
Wellesley converted the British Empire in India to the British
Empire of India. From one of the political powers in India, the
Company became the supreme power in India and claimed the
whole country as its sole protectorate. From Wellesley’s time
onwards the defence of India was the Company’s responsibility.
—Sidney J. Owen (Selection from
Wellesley’s Despatches)

States which Accepted Alliance
The Indian princes who accepted the subsidiary system were:
the Nizam of Hyderabad (September 1798 and 1800), the
ruler of Mysore (1799), the ruler of Tanjore (October 1799),
the Nawab of Awadh (November 1801), the Peshwa (December
1801), the Bhonsle Raja of Berar (December 1803), the
Sindhia (February 1804), the Rajput states of Jodhpur, Jaipur,
Macheri, Bundi and the ruler of Bharatpur (1818). The
Holkars were the last Maratha confederation to accept the
Subsidiary Alliance in 1818.

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  123
Views
A 1950 Colonial Office paper disarmingly says that Britain ‘as
a seafaring and trading nation... had long been a “collector of
islands and peninsulas”’. In a much-quoted remark, Sir John
Seeley, the Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge,
said something similar in 1883: ‘We seem, as it were, to have
conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind.
That didn’t mean quite what it seemed to say: what Seeley meant
was that there had not been a coherent policy behind Britain’s
imperial expansion. There had been an incoherent set of policies.
The 1950 paper explained that the collection of islands and
peninsulas was assembled to protect trade and the sea routes.
The motive for Empire was selfish… the motivation consisted
of desires which interlocked: desires for wealth, for strategic
possessions from which to defend the wealth, and for prestige,
the inevitable concomitant of wealth. In the process, numberless
hundreds of thousands of native populations were slaughtered,
… Almost always, the subject races, even the most sophisticated
and educated amongst them, were regarded as and made to
feel inferior to the ruling caste.
—Walter Reid, Keeping the Jewel in the Crown
In the hundred years after Plassey, the East India Company,
with an army of 260,000 men at the start of the nineteenth
century and the backing of the British government and Parliament
(many of whose members were shareholders in the enterprise),
extended its control over most of India. The Company conquered
and absorbed a number of hitherto independent or autonomous
states, imposed executive authority through a series of highborn Governors General appointed from London, regulated the
country’s trade, collected taxes and imposed its fiat on all
aspects of Indian life.
Shashi Tharoor, An Era of Darkness

Doctrine of Lapse

In simple terms, the doctrine stated that the adopted son
could be the heir to his foster father’s private property, but
not the state; it was for the paramount power (the British)
to decide whether to bestow the state on the adopted son
or to annex it. The doctrine was stated to be based on Hindu
law and Indian customs, but Hindu law seemed to be
somewhat inconclusive on this point, and the instances of

124  

an Indian sovereign annexing the state of his vassal on account
of ‘lapse’ (i.e., leaving no issue as heir) were rather rare.
Maharaja Ranjit Singh had annexed a few of his feudatory
principalities on account of ‘lapse’. Likewise, the Company
in 1820 acquired a few petty Cis-Sutlej states on the absence
of heirs. Nonetheless, there was no clear-cut instance of an
adopted son being deprived of an entire state or of such a
state being regarded as a ‘lapse’.
Though this policy is attributed to Lord Dalhousie
(1848-56), he was not its originator. It was a coincidence
that during his governor-generalship several important cases
arose in which the ‘Doctrine’ could be applied. Dalhousie
showed too much zeal in enforcing this policy which had been
theoretically enunciated on some previous occasions. His
Annexation of Awadh
Awadh was the oldest of the surviving states brought under the
Subsidiary Alliance and the cruel impact of the system resulted
in its continuous maladministration under profligate and extravagant
nawabs for a long spell of 80 years.
The people suffered from the heavy taxes imposed by the
Nawab as also the illegal exactions by his officials and the
talukdars. The chronic bankruptcy of the treasury was partly due
to the heavy charges realised by the British government for
maintenance of the subsidiary troops. In addition, large contributions
were realised by Lord Hastings, Lord Amherst and Lord William
Bentinck for purposes entirely unconnected with the affairs of
Awadh. In 1819, the Nawab was given the title and status of a
king.
Lord Dalhousie directed Sleeman, the Resident in Awadh, to
make a tour throughout the state and ascertain the actual situation
by personal inspection. The resident submitted a report describing
the anarchical condition in the state. He was succeeded as resident
in 1854 by Outram who submitted a report supporting that of his
predecessor. Dalhousie hesitated to take the extreme step, i.e.,
annexation; he preferred permanent British administration, with the
Nawab retaining his titles and rank. But the Court of Directors
ordered annexation and abolition of the throne (1856). Wajid Ali Shah
refused to sign a treaty giving away his rights, and was exiled
to Calcutta. It was a political blunder for which the British had to
pay a heavy price during the Revolt of 1857.

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  125

predecessors had acted on the general principle of avoiding
annexation if it could be avoided; Dalhousie in turn acted
on the general principle of annexing if he could do so
legitimately.
Annexed Lapsed States
It was a matter of chance that during Lord Dalhousie’s term
many rulers of states died without a male issue and seven
states were annexed under the Doctrine of Lapse. The most
important of these were Satara (1848), Jhansi and Nagpur
(1854). The other small states included Jaitpur (Bundelkhand),
Sambhalpur (Orissa), and Baghat (Madhya Pradesh).
Lord Dalhousie annexed Awadh in 1856 after deposing
Nawab Wajid Ali Shah on grounds of misgovernment.
Thus Dalhousie annexed eight states during his eightyear tenure (1848-56) as governor-general. In these eight
years, he annexed some quarter million square miles of the
territory of India. His reign almost completed the process
of expansion of British power in India, which began with the
victory over Siraj-ud-daula at Plassey in 1757.

Relations of British India with
Neighbouring Countries
The desire of the British imperialists to consolidate their
administrative and political power in the region led them into
conflict with countries neighbouring India.

Anglo-Bhutanese Relations

The occupation of Assam in 1826 brought the British into
close contacts with the mountain state of Bhutan. Frequent
raids by Bhutanese into adjoining territories in Assam and
Bengal and the bad treatment meted out to Elgin’s envoy in
1863-64 and the treaty imposed on him, by which the British
were forced to surrender the passes leading to Assam, led
to British annexation of these passes and the stopping of
allowance paid to the Bhutanese. In 1865, the Bhutanese were
forced to surrender the passes in return for an annual subsidy.
It was the surrendered district which became a productive
area with tea gardens.

126  

Anglo-Nepalese Relations

The Gorkhas wrested control of Nepal from the successors
of Ranjit Malla of Bhatgaon in 1760. They began to expand
their dominion beyond the mountains. They found it easier
to expand in the southern direction, as the north was well
defended by the Chinese. In 1801, the English annexed
Gorakhpur which brought the Gorkhas’ boundary and the
Company’s boundary together. The conflict started due to the
Gorkhas’ capture of Butwal and Sheoraj in the period of Lord
Hastings (1813-23). The war, ended in the Treaty of Sagauli,
1816 which was in favour of the British.
As per the treaty,
● Nepal accepted a British resident.
● Nepal ceded the districts of Garhwal and Kumaon,
and abandoned claims to Terai.
● Nepal also withdrew from Sikkim.
This agreement brought many advantages to the British—
● the British empire now reached the Himalayas;
● it got better facilities for trade with Central Asia;
● it acquired sites for hill stations, such as Shimla,
Mussoorie and Nainital; and
● the Gorkhas joined the British Indian Army in large
numbers.

Anglo-Burmese Relations

In the beginning of the 19th century, Burma was a free
country and wanted to expand westward. The expansionist
urges of the British, fuelled by the lure of the forest
resources of Burma, market for British manufactures in
Burma and the need to check French ambitions in Burma and
the rest of South-East Asia, resulted in three Anglo-Burmese
Wars, and in the end, the annexation of Burma into British
India in 1885.
First Burma War (1824-26)
The first war with Burma was fought when the Burmese
expansion westwards and occupation of Arakan and Manipur,
and the threat to Assam and the Brahmaputra Valley led to
continuous friction along the ill-defined border between
Bengal and Burma, in the opening decades of the nineteenth

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  127

century. The British expeditionary forces occupied Rangoon
in May 1824 and reached within 72 km of the capital at Ava.
Peace was established in 1826 with the Treaty of Yandabo
which provided that the Government of Burma
● pay rupees one crore as war compensation;
● cede its coastal provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim;
● abandon claims on Assam, Cachar and Jaintia;
● recognise Manipur as an independent state;
● negotiate a commercial treaty with Britain; and
● accept a British resident at Ava, while posting a
Burmese envoy at Calcutta.
Second Burma War (1852)
The second war was the result of the British commercial need
and the imperialist policy of Lord Dalhousie. The British
merchants were keen to get hold of timber resources of upper
Burma and also sought further inroads into the Burmese
market. This time, the British occupied Pegu, the only
remaining coastal province of Burma. An intense guerrilla
resistance had to be overcome before complete British
control of lower Burma could be established.
Third Burma War (1885)
After the death of Burmese King Bhindan, his son Thibaw
succeeded to the throne. Thibaw, from the beginning itself,
was hostile towards the British. The British merchants at
Rangoon and lower Burma had been complaining about the
step-motherly treatment by Thibaw, who had also been
negotiating commercial treaties with the rival powers of
France, Germany and Italy. The French also planned to lay
a rail link from Mandalay to the French territory at a time
when the British were in conflict with the French in Niger,
Egypt and Madagascar. A humiliating fine had been imposed
on a British timber company by Thibaw. Dufferin ordered
the invasion and final annexation of upper Burma in 1885.
[The British had to face a strong guerrilla uprising in
the whole of Burma soon after, and a nationalist movement
after the First World War. The Burmese nationalists joined
hands with the Indian National Congress. To weaken this link,
Burma was separated from India in 1935. The Burmese

128  

nationalist movement further intensified under U Aung San
during the Second World War, which finally led to the
independence of Burma on January 4, 1948.]

Anglo-Tibetan Relations

Tibet was ruled by a theocracy of Buddhist monks (lamas)
under nominal suzerainty of China. The British efforts to
establish friendly and commercial relations with Tibet had
not yielded any result in the past and a deadlock had been
reached by the time of Curzon’s arrival in India. The Chinese
suzerainty over Tibet was ineffective and Russian influence
at Lhasa was increasing. There were reports of Russian arms
and ammunition coming into Tibet. Curzon felt alarmed and
sent a small Gorkha contingent under Colonel Younghusband
on a special mission to Tibet to oblige the Tibetans to come
to an agreement. The Tibetans refused to negotiate and
offered non-violent resistance. Younghusband pushed his way
into Lhasa (August 1904) while the Dalai Lama fled.
Treaty of Lhasa (1904)
Younghusband dictated terms to the Tibetan officials which
provided that—
● Tibet would pay an indemnity of Rs 75 lakh at the
rate of one lakh rupees per annum;
● as a security for payment, the Indian Government
would occupy the Chumbi Valley (territory between Bhutan
and Sikkim) for 75 years;
● Tibet would respect the frontier of Sikkim;
● Trade marts would be opened at Yatung, Gyantse,
Gartok; and
● Tibet would not grant any concession for railways,
roads, telegraph, etc., to any foreign state, but give Great
Britain some control over foreign affairs of Tibet.
Later, on the insistence of the Secretary of State and
true to the pledge given to Russia, the treaty was revised
reducing the indemnity from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 25 lakh and
providing for evacuation of Chumbi valley after three years
(the valley was actually evacuated only in January 1908).
Significance Only China gained in the end out of the
whole affair because the Anglo-Russian convention of 1907

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  129

provided that the two great powers would not negotiate with
Tibet, except through the mediation of the Chinese government.
However, Curzon’s policy counteracted all Russian schemes
in Tibet.

Anglo-Afghan Relations

In the early nineteenth century, increased Russian influence
in Persia replaced British influence and thwarted an English
scheme for establishment of a new route by River Euphrates
to India. Especially after the Treaty of Turkomanchai (1828),
the English got alarmed about possible Russian plans regarding
India. Soon, there was a search for a scientific frontier from
the Indian side. Passes of the north-west seemed to hold the
key to enter India. The need was felt for Afghanistan to be
under control of a ruler friendly to the British.
Forward Policy of Auckland
Auckland who came to India as the governor-general in 1836,
advocated a forward policy. This implied that the Company
government in India itself had to take initiatives to protect
the boundary of British India from a probable Russian attack.
This objective was to be achieved either through treaties with
the neighbouring countries or by annexing them completely.
The Amir of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammed, wanted British
friendship but made it conditional on the British helping him
to recover Peshawar from the Sikhs—a condition which the
British government in India rejected. Dost Mohammed now
turned to Russia and Persia for help. This prompted the
British government to go ahead with the forward policy, and
a Tripartite Treaty (1838) was entered into by the British,
Sikhs and Shah Shuja (who had been deposed from the Afghan
throne in 1809 and had been living since then as a British
pensioner at Ludhiana). The treaty provided that—
● Shah Shuja be enthroned with the armed help of the
Sikhs, the Company remaining in the background, ‘jingling
the money-bag’;
● Shah Shuja conduct foreign affairs with the advice
of the Sikhs and the British;
● Shah Shuja give up his sovereign rights over Amirs
of Sindh in return for a large sum of money;

130  
● Shah Shuja recognise the Sikh ruler, Maharaja Ranjit
Singh’s claims over the Afghan territories on the right bank
of the River Indus.
First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842)
Soon after the tripartite treaty of 1838, there came about
a drastic change in the political situation of the region
because of the removal of the original irritants—Persia lifted
its siege of Herat and Russia recalled its envoy from Kabul.
Nevertheless, the British decided to go ahead with their
forward policy. This resulted in the First Afghan War (183942). The British intention was to establish a permanent barrier
against schemes of aggression from the north-west.
An English army entered triumphantly into Kabul
(August 1839) after a successful attack. Most of the tribes
had already been won over by bribes. Dost Mohammed
surrendered (1840) and Shah Shuja was made the Amir of
Afghanistan. But Shah Shuja was unacceptable to the Afghans.
As soon as the British withdrew, the Afghans rose in
rebellion, killing the garrison commander in Kabul. The
British were compelled to sign a treaty (1841) with the
Afghan chiefs by which they agreed to evacuate Afghanistan
and restore Dost Mohammed. But the English plan failed.
Under a new expedition, the British re-occupied Kabul in
September 1842, but having learned their lesson well, they
arrived at a settlement with Dost Mohammed by which the
British evacuated from Kabul and recognised him as the
independent ruler of Afghanistan.
The First Afghan War cost India one-and-a-half crore
rupees and nearly 20,000 men.

John Lawrence and the Policy of
Masterly Inactivity

John Lawrence (1864-1869) started a policy of masterly
inactivity which was a reaction to the disasters of the First
Afghan War and an outcome of practical common sense and
an intimate knowledge of the frontier problem and of Afghan
passion for independence. Even when Dost Mohammed died
in 1863, there was no interference in the war of succession.
Lawrence’s policy rested on the fulfilment of two

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  131

Sir John Lawrence’s foreign policy was a policy of self-reliance
and self-restraint, of defence not defiance, of waiting and
watching that he might be able to strike harder and in the right
direction, if the time for aggressive action should ever come.

conditions—(i) that the peace at the frontier was not
disturbed, and (ii) that no candidate in civil war sought foreign
help. And as Sher Ali established himself on the throne,
Lawrence tried to cultivate friendship with him.

Lytton and the Policy of Proud Reserve

Lytton, a nominee of the Conservative government under
Benjamin Disraeli (1874-80), became the Viceroy of India
in 1876. He started a new foreign policy of ‘proud reserve’,
which was aimed at having scientific frontiers and safeguarding
‘spheres of influence’. According to Lytton, the relations
with Afghanistan could no longer be left ambiguous.
Second Anglo-Afghan War (1870-80)
Lytton made an offer of a favourable treaty to Sher Ali, but
the Amir wanted friendship with both his powerful neighbours,
Russia and British India, while keeping both of them at an
arm’s length. Later, Sher Ali refused to keep a British envoy
in Kabul while having earlier granted a similar concession
to the Russians. Lytton was displeased, and when the Russians
withdrew their envoy from Kabul, Lytton decided to invade
Afghanistan. Sher Ali fled in face of the British invasion, and
the Treaty of Gandamak (May 1879) was signed with Yakub
Khan, the eldest son of Sher Ali.
Treaty of Gandamak (May 1879) The treaty signed
after the Second-Anglo Afghan War provided that:
● the Amir conduct his foreign policy with the advice
of Government of India;
● a permanent British resident be stationed at Kabul;
and
● the Government of India give Amir all support against
foreign aggression, and an annual subsidy.
But soon, Yakub had to abdicate under popular pressure

132  

and the British had to recapture Kabul and Kandhar. Abdur
Rehman became the new Amir. Lytton chalked out a plan for
the dismemberment of Afghanistan, but could not carry it out.
Ripon abandoned this plan and decided on a policy of keeping
Afghanistan as a buffer state.
(After the First World War and the Russian Revolution
(1917), the Afghans demanded full independence. Habibullah
(who succeeded Abdur Rahman in 1901) was killed in 1919
and the new ruler Amamullah declared open war on the
British. Peace came in 1921 when Afghanistan recovered
independence in foreign affairs.)

British India and the
North-West Frontier
Successive Indian rulers tried to reach out to this region lying
between the Indus and Afghanistan in their search for a
scientific frontier. The conquest of Sindh (1843) and
annexation of Punjab (1849) carried British boundaries
beyond the Indus and brought them in contact with Baluch
and Pathan tribes, who were mostly independent, but the Amir
of Afghanistan claimed nominal suzerainty over them.
During 1891-92 the British occupation of Hunza, Nagar
in Gilgit valley, which were passes commanding
communications with Chitral, alarmed Abdur Rahman (Amir
of Afghanistan). A compromise was finally reached by
drawing a boundary line known as Durand Line between
Afghan and British territories. Amir received some districts
and his subsidy was increased. But the Durand Agreement
(1893) failed to keep peace and soon there were tribal
uprisings. To check these, a permanent British garrison was
established at Chitral and troops posted to guard Malakand
Pass, but tribal uprisings continued till 1898.
Curzon, the viceroy between 1899 and 1905, followed
a policy of withdrawal and concentration. British troops
withdrew from advanced posts which were replaced by tribal
levies, trained and commanded by British officers. He also
encouraged the tribals to maintain peace. He created the
North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) directly under the

Expansion and Consolidation of British Power  133

Government of India (earlier, it was under control of the
lieutenant-governor of Punjab). Overall, Curzon’s policies
resulted in a peaceful north-west frontier. The peaceful
conditions continued thereafter with occasional tribal
uprisings. In January 1932, it was announced that the NWFP
was to be constituted as a governor’s province. Since 1947,
the province belongs to Pakistan.

People’s Resistance
Against British
Before 1857
Most of us think of the 1857 Revolt as the first major show
of resentment against the British who were represented by
the rule of the East India Company. However, there were
many incidents before the 1857 revolt that indicated all was
not well and that there was a building resentment against the
alien rule. This resentment manifested itself in several bouts
of resistance by different groups of people in different
regions of India.
136

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  137

People’s Resistance: Meaning
In the context of people’s resistance against the British rule,
the word ‘people’ encompasses several sections of the Indian
society who were affected by the alien rule. The peasants,
artisans, tribals, ruling classes (active or dispossessed),
military personnel (those under the Company as well as the
demobilised soldiers of ex-rulers), religious leaders (Hindu
and Muslim), etc., fought for the protection of their interests,
at times separately and at times together. The agitation in
Benares in 1810 against a house tax imposed by the colonial
government, the Surat riots in 1814 against the salt duty, the
rising in Bareilly in 1816 against police tax and municipal
taxes, are some examples of urban movements in which
people from lower strata like artisans, petty shopkeepers, and
the urban poor fought together with the prosperous urban
gentry. The interests of these resistances differed in the
sense that each section had different grievances, but converged
on a common objective—to end the British rule.
According to Bipan Chandra, people’s resistance took
three broad forms: civil rebellions, tribal uprisings and
peasant movements. We have also considered military
revolts as a form of people’s resistance, which involved
Indians employed in the Company’s forces, to make the study
of people’s resistance more comprehensive.

Genesis of People’s Resistance
In pre-colonial India, people’s protests against the rulers and
their officials were not uncommon—high land revenue
demand by the State, corrupt practices and hard attitude of
the officials being some of the instigating factors. However,
the establishment of colonial rule and its policies had a much
more annihilative effect on the Indians as a whole. There was
no one to hear their grievances or pay attention to their
problems. The Company was merely interested in extracting
revenue.
The colonial law and judiciary safeguarded the interest
of the government and its collaborators—the landlords, the
merchants and money-lenders. Thus the people left with no
options, chose to take up arms and defend themselves. The

138  

conditions of the tribal people were not different from those
of the people living in the mainland but the encroachment
by outsiders into their independent tribal polity made them
more aggrieved and violent.

Causative Factors for People’s Uprisings

The major factors responsible for the people’s resentment
and uprisings against the Company rule are as follows.
● Colonial land revenue settlements, heavy burden of
new taxes, eviction of peasants from their lands, and
encroachments on tribal lands.
● Exploitation in rural society coupled with the growth
of intermediary revenue collectors, tenants and moneylenders.
● Expansion of revenue administration over tribal lands
leading to the loss of tribal people’s hold over agricultural
and forest land.
● Promotion of British manufactured goods, heavy
duties on Indian industries, especially export duties, leading
to devastation of Indian handloom and handicraft industries.
● Destruction of indigenous industry leading to migration
of workers from industry to agriculture, increasing the
pressure on land/agriculture.

Civil Uprisings
The word ‘civil’ encompasses everything which is not related
to defence/military, but here we have included those uprisings
which were generally led by deposed native rulers or their
descendants, former zamindars, landlords, poligars (—in
South India, holders of territory or palayam, consisting of
a few villages granted to them by the rulers—mainly the
Nayakas—in return for military service and tribute), exretainers and officials of the conquered kingdoms, or
sometimes by religious leaders. The mass support generally
came from rack-rented peasants, unemployed artisans and
demobilised soldiers, although at the centre of these uprisings
were erstwhile power-wielding classes.

Major Causes of Civil Uprisings

● Under the Company rule, there were rapid changes in
the economy, administration and land revenue system that went
against the people.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  139
● Several zamindars and poligars who had lost control
over their land and its revenues due to the colonial rule, had
personal scores to settle with the new rulers.
● The ego of traditional zamindars and poligars was hurt
due to being sidelined in rank by government officials and a
new class comprising of merchants and money-lenders.
● The ruin of Indian handicraft industries due to colonial
policies impoverished millions of artisans whose misery was
further compounded by the disappearance of their traditional
patrons and buyers—princes, chieftains, and zamindars.
● The priestly classes instigated hatred and rebellion
against alien rule, because the religious preachers, priests,
pundits, maulvis, etc., had been dependent on the traditional
landed and bureaucratic elite. The fall of zamindars and feudal
lords directly affected the priestly class.
● The foreign character of the British rulers, who always
remained alien to this land, and their contemptuous treatment
of the native people hurt the pride of the latter.

General Characteristics of Civil Uprisings

These uprisings in most cases represented common conditions,
though separated in time and place.
The semi-feudal leaders of civil uprisings were backward
looking and traditional in outlook. Their basic objective was to
restore earlier forms of rule and social relations.
These uprisings were the result of local causes and
grievances and were also localised in their consequences.

Important Civil Uprisings
Sanyasi Revolt (1763-1800)
The disastrous famine of 1770 and the harsh economic order
of the British compelled a group of sanyasis in Eastern India
to fight the British yoke. Originally peasants, even some
evicted from land, these sanyasis were joined by a large
number of dispossessed small zamindars, disbanded soldiers
and rural poor. They raided Company factories and the
treasuries, and fought the Company’s forces. It was only after
a prolonged action that Warren Hastings could subdue the
sanyasis. Equal participation of Hindus and Muslims
characterised the uprisings, sometimes referred to as the

140  

Fakir Rebellion. Majnum Shah (or Majnu Shah), Chirag Ali,
Musa Shah, Bhawani Pathak and Debi Chaudhurani were
important leaders. Debi Chaudhurani’s participation recognises
the women’s role in early resistances against the British.
Anandamath, a semi-historical novel by Bankim Chandra
Chattopadhyay, is based on the Sanyasi Revolt. Bankim
Chandra also wrote a novel, Devi Chaudhurani, as he saw
the importance of women too taking up the struggle against
an alien rule that posed a threat to traditional Indian values.
Revolt in Midnapore and Dhalbhum (1766-74)
The English took hold of Midnapore in 1760 and at that time
there were about 3,000 zamindars and talukdars having cordial
relations with their ryots. But this harmonious scenario
changed after the introduction of new land revenue system
by the English in 1772. According to the British governor
Vansittart, the zamindars of Midnapore sided with the ryots
in case of conflict between the ryots and the English revenue
collecting officials. The zamindars of Dhalbhum, Manbhum,
Raipur, Panchet, Jhatibuni, Karnagarh, and Bagri, living in the
vast tract of Jungle Mahals of west and north-west
Midnapore—were ultimately dispossessed of their zamindaries
by 1800s. The important leaders of the uprisings were
Damodar Singh and Jagannath Dhal.
Revolt of Moamarias (1769-99)
The revolt of the Moamarias in 1769 was a potent challenge
to the authority of Ahom kings of Assam. The Moamarias
were low-caste peasants who followed the teachings of
Aniruddhadeva (1553-1624), and their rise was similar to that
of other low-caste groups in north India. Their revolts
weakened the Ahoms and opened the doors for others to
attack the region, for instance, in 1792, the King of Darrang
(Krishnanarayan), assisted by his band of burkandazes (the
demobilised soldiers of the Muslim armies and zamindars)
revolted. To crush these revolts, the Ahom ruler had to
request for British help. The Moamarias made Bhatiapar their
headquarters. Rangpur (now in Bangladesh) and Jorhat were
the most affected region. Although, the Ahom kingdom
survived the rebellion, the weakened kingdom fell to a
Burmese invasion and finally came under British rule.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  141

Civil Uprisings in Gorakhpur, Basti
and Bahraich (1781)
Warren Hastings, in order to meet the war expenses against
the Marathas and Mysore, made a plan to earn money by
involving English officers as izaradars (revenue farmers) in
Awadh. He involved Major Alexander Hannay, who was well
acquainted with the region, as an izaradar in 1778. Hannay
secured the izara of Gorakhpur and Bahraich to the amount
of 22 lakh rupees for one year. In fact, it was a secret
experiment by the Company to see for itself just how much
surplus money was accessible in practice.
However, Hannay’s oppression and excessive demand
of revenue made the region, which had been in a flourishing
state under the Nawab, panic-striken. The zamindars and
cultivators rose against the unbearable exactions in 1781 and,
within weeks of the initial uprising, all of Hannay’s
subordinates were either killed or besieged by zamindari
guerilla forces. Although the rebellion was suppressed,
Hannay was dismissed and his izara forcibly removed.
Revolt of Raja of Vizianagaram (1794)
In 1758, a treaty was made between the English and Ananda
Gajapatiraju, the ruler of Vizianagaram, to jointly oust the
French from the Northern Circars. In this mission they were
successful but the English, as was usual in their case in India,
went back on their word to honour the terms of the treaty.
Anand Raju died before he could seriously tackle the English.
The East India Company went on to demand a tribute of three
lakh rupees from Vizayaramaraju, the Raja of Vizianagaram
and asked him to disband his troops. This angered the raja
as there were no dues to be paid to the Company. The raja
supported by his subjects rose up in revolt. The English
captured the raja in 1793 and ordered him to go into exile
with a pension. The raja refused. The raja died in a battle
at Padmanabham (in modern Visakhapatnam district in Andhra
Pradesh) in 1794. Vizianagaram came under the Company’s
rule. Later, the Company offered the estate to the deceased
raja’s son and reduced the demand for presents.
Revolt of Dhundia in Bednur (1799-1800)
After the conquest of Mysore in 1799, the English had to
confront many native leaders. Dhundia Wagh, a local Maratha

142  

leader, who was converted to Islam by Tipu Sultan and put
into jail due to his mis-adventures, got released with the fall
of Seringapatam. Very soon, Dhundia organised a force which
consisted of anti-British elements, and carved out a small
territory for himself. A defeat by the English in August 1799
forced him to take refuge in Maratha region from where he
instigated the disappointed princes to fight against the English
and he himself took on the leadership. In September 1800,
he was killed while fighting against the British forces under
Wellesley. Though Dhundia failed, he became a venerated
leader of the masses.
Resistance of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja
(1797; 1800-05)
Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, popularly known as Kerala
Simham (Lion of Kerala) or ‘Pyche raja’, was the de facto
head of Kottayam (Cotiote) in Malabar region. Apart from
resisting Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, Kerala Varma fought
against the British between 1793 and 1805.
The Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790-92), extended
English paramountcy over Kottayam in violation of an earlier
agreement of 1790 which had recognised the independence
of Kottayam. The English appointed Vira Varma, the uncle
of Pazhassi Raja, as the Raja of Kottayam. The new raja, to
meet the revenue target fixed by the Company, levied
exorbitant rates of tax on the peasants. This led to a mass
resistance by the peasants under the leadership of Pazhassi
Raja in 1793. Pazhassi Raja fought bravely using guerilla
warfare, and in 1797 a peace treaty was made. But a conflict
over a dispute on Wayanad in 1800 started an insurgent
warfare. Pazhassi Raja organised a large force of Nairs which
was supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans, the latter being
demobilised soldiers of Tipu who had become unemployed
after Tipu’s death. In November 1805, the Kerala Simham
died in a gun-fight at Mavila Todu near present day KeralaKarnataka border.
Civil Rebellion in Awadh (1799)
Wazir Ali Khan, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, with the help
of the British, had ascended the throne in September 1797.
But very soon his relations with the British became sour and

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  143

he got replaced by his uncle, Saadat Ali Khan II. Wazir Ali
Khan was granted a pension in Benares. However, in January
1799, he killed a British resident, Geogre Frederik Cherry,
who had invited him to lunch. Wazir Ali’s guards killed two
other Europeans and even attacked the Magistrate of Benares.
The whole incident became famous as the Massacre of
Benares. Wazir Ali was able to assemble an army of several
thousand men which was defeated by General Erskine. Wazir
Ali fled to Butwal and was granted asylum by the ruler of
Jaipur. Arthur Wellesley requested the Raja of Jaipur to
extradite Wazir Ali. Wazir Ali was extradited on the condition
that he would neither be hanged nor be put in fetters. After
surrender in December 1799, he was placed in confinement
at Fort William, Calcutta.
Uprisings in Ganjam and Gumsur (1800, 1835-37)
In the Northern Circars, Ganjam and its adjoining regions
rose in revolt against the British rule. Strikara Bhanj, a
zamindar of Gumsur in Ganjam district, refused to pay
revenues in 1797. In 1800, he openly rebelled and defied
the public authorities. Snodgrass, an oppressive and corrupt
collector, was replaced to suppress the insurrection. Strikara
was joined by Jlani Deo of Vizianagar (Poddakimedi) and
Jagannath Deo of Pratapgiri (Chinakimedi). In 1804 Jagannath
Deo was captured and sent to Masulipatnam. But the English
had to assign certain districts to Strikara Bhanj. In 1807-08,
Dhananjaya Bhanj, son of Strikara, forced his father to leave
the estate. Dhananjaya rebelled against the English but was
forced to surrender in June 1815.
Strikara, who had returned to Ganjam, was reappointed
as the zamindar in a compromise with the government. He
managed the estate between 1819 and 1830 but, failing to
liquidate the arrears, retired in favour of his son, Dhananjay.
However, unable to pay the enormous arrears, Dhananjay
Bhanj rose in rebellion for the second time when the British
forces occupied Gumsur and Kolaida in November 1835. The
revolt greatly reduced the government’s authority but
Dhananjay died in December 1835 and his followers continued
the resistance. The government appointed Russell, with full
discretionary powers, to deal with the situation. The struggle

144  

lasted till February 1837, when Doora Bisayi, a formidable
leader, was arrested. The zamindari of Gumsur was forfeited.
Uprisings in Palamau (1800-02)
The political situation of Palamau was complicated by the
crises of agrarian landlordism and feudal system. In 1800,
Bhukhan Singh, a Chero chief, rose in rebellion. Colonel
Jones camped for two years in Palamau and Sarguja to
suppress the rebellion. Bhukhan Singh died in 1802 and
subsequently the insurrection calmed down.
Poligars’ Revolt (1795-1805)
The poligars (or palayakkarargal) of South India gave a stiff
resistance to the British between 1795 and 1805. The main
centres of these strong uprisings were Tinneveli (or
Thirunelveli), Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Sivagiri, Madurai,
and North Arcot. The problem started in 1781, when the
Nawab of Arcot gave the management and control of Tinneveli
and the Carnatic Provinces to the East India Company. This
arrangement caused resentment among the poligars who had,
for long considered themselves as independent sovereign
authorities within their respective territories. The first revolt
of the poligars against the Company was basically over
taxation, but had a larger political dimension in that the
English considered and treated the poligars as enemies.
Kattabomman Nayakan, the poligar of Panjalankurichi, led
the insurrection between 1795 and 1799. After a fierce battle
in which the Company forces were defeated by Veerapandiya
Kattabomman, a price was put on the latter’s head. This led
to greater rebellion by the poligars. With reinforcements the
Company forces were finally able to defeat Kattabomman.
Kattabomman fled into the Pudukottai forests. Once again
a betrayal—this time by Ettappan, the Raja of Pudukottai, who
entered into an agreement with the British—led to the capture
of Kattabomman. Kattabomman was hanged in a conspicuous
place. A close associate, Subramania Pillai was also hanged
and Soundara Pandian, another rebel, brutally killed. The
palayam of Panjalankurichi and the estates of five other
poligars who had joined the rebellion were confiscated and
the prominent poligars executed or sent to prison.
The second phase, which was more violent than the

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  145

previous one, started in February 1801 when the poligars
imprisoned in the fort of Palamcotta were able to escape.
The rebels took control of many forts and even captured
Tuticorin. The British forces were soon reinforced from
Malabar. The fugitives led by Oomathurai, brother of
Kattabomman, who fled to Sivaganga in Ramnad joined the
rebellion of the ‘Marudus’ led by Marathu Pandian which was
suppressed in October 1801. The fort of Panjalankurichi was
razed to the ground and the name of the place was expunged
from all the documents of the district. Meanwhile, the nawab
surrendered the civil and military administration of all the
territories and dependencies of the Carnatic exclusively to
the Company in perpetuity.
Between 1803 and 1805, the poligars of North Arcot
rose in rebellion, when they were deprived of their right to
collect the kaval fees. (Kaval or ‘watch’ was an ancient
institution of Tamil Nadu. It was a hereditary village police
office with specified rights and responsibilities.) The region
was in a lawless condition particularly in the palayams of
Chittur and Chandragiri. The poligar of Yedaragunta, who
proved most daring and desperate among the insurgent chiefs,
was joined by the dispossessed poligar of Charagallu. By
February 1805, the rebels were suppressed. Several chiefs
were ordered to reside in Madras while some others were
granted an allowance of 18 per cent upon revenues of their
estates.
The poligar rebellion spread over a vast area of South
India. The proclamations by the rebels, says A. Shunmugaiah,
indicate that they believed in a mass movement against the
alien rule, seeking independence of them.
Uprising in Bhiwani (1809)
In 1809, the Jats of Haryana broke into rebellion. The Jats
fortified themselves in Bhiwani and made a strong resistance.
A brigade of all arms, with a powerful battering ram, was
required to suppress the revolt.
Diwan Velu Thampi’s Revolt (1808-1809)
The East India Company’s harsh conditions imposed on the
state of Travancore, after both of them agreed to a subsidiary
alliance arrangement under Wellesley in 1805, caused deep

146  

resentment in the region. The ruler was not able to pay the
subsidy and fell in arrears. The British resident of Travancore
was meddling in the internal affairs of the state. The highhanded attitude of the Company compelled Prime Minister
(or Dalawa) Velu Thampi to rise against the Company,
assisted by the Nair troops. Velu Thampi addressed a
gathering in Kundara, openly calling for taking up arms
against the British to oust them from the native soil. This
was later known as the Kundara Proclamation. There was
large scale rebellion against the British as a result. A large
military operation had to be undertaken to restore peace. The
Maharaja of Travancore had not wholly supported the rebellion
and defected to the side of the Company. Velu Thampi killed
himself to avoid capture. The rebellion petered out.
Disturbances in Bundelkhand (1808-12)
The vast province of Bundelkhand, conquered by the British
during the Second Anglo-Maratha Wars (1803-05), was put
within the Presidency of Bengal. The Bundela chiefs offered
resistance to the new government as long as they could fight
from their forts numbering nearly one hundred and fifty. The
first major resistance came from Lakshaman Dawa, the
killadar (fort commander) of Ajaygarh fort. Lakshman was
permitted to retain the fort as a temporary arrangement for
two years ending in 1808, but he wanted to continue his hold
after the expiry of the term. He surrendered in February 1809
and was taken to Calcutta. The next resistance came from
killadar of Kalanjar, Darya Singh, which was suppressed in
January 1812. But the most serious threat came from a
famous military adventurer named Gopal Singh, who had a
dispute with his uncle who was supported by the British. For
four years Gopal Singh eluded all vigilance and military
tactics of British forces. To put a stop to these disturbances,
the British had to adopt a policy of binding down the
hereditary chieftains of Bundelkhand by a series of contractual
obligations—Ikarnamahs.
Parlakimedi Outbreak (1813-34)
Parlakimedi, situated in the western border of Ganjam district
(now in Odisha), witnessed resistance from the zamindars and
rajas. When the Company acquired Ganjam, Narayan Deo was

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  147

the raja of Parlakimedi, whose resistance forced the British
to dispatch an army under Colonel Peach. Peach defeated
Narayan Deo in 1768 and made Gajapathi Deo (son of
Narayan) proclaimed zamindar. But Narayan Deo, supported
by his son and brothers, revolted again. As the resistance
failed to calm down, the Presidency of Madras appointed
George Russell as commissioner of the region in 1832.
Russell, provided with full fledged powers to suppress the
revolt, pacified the region by 1834.
Kutch or Cutch Rebellion (1816-1832)
There was a treaty between the British and Maharaja Bharamal
II of Kutch in 1816, by which power was vested in the throne.
There was, however, a power struggle between the maharaja
and a group of chieftains.
The British interfered in the internal feuds of the Kutch
and, in 1819, Raja Bharmal II raised Arab and African troops
with the firm intention of removing the British from his
territory. The chieftains ranged on his side. The British
defeated and deposed the Kutch ruler Rao Bharamal in favour
of his infant son. A British resident governed the areas as
the de facto ruler with the help of a regency council. The
administrative innovations made by the regency council
coupled with excessive land assessment caused deep
resentment. In the meanwhile, some of the chieftains continued
their rebellion against alien rule. The news of the British
reverses in the Burma War emboldened the chiefs to rise
in revolt and demand the restoration of Bharamal II. After
extensive military operations failed to control the situation,
the Company’s authorities were compelled to follow a
conciliatory policy.
Rising at Bareilly (1816)
The immediate cause of upsurge was the imposition of the
police tax which aroused the burning indignation of the
citizens. The issue became religious when Mufti Muhammad
Aiwaz, a venerated old man, gave a petition to the magistrate
of the town in March 1816.
The situation aggravated further when the police, while
collecting tax, injured a woman. This event led to a bloody
scuffle between the followers of the Mufti and the police.

148  

Within two days of the event, several armed Muslims from
Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur and Rampur rose in rebellion for the
defence of the faith and the Mufti. In April 1816, the
insurgents murdered the son of Leycester (judge of provincial
court of Bareilly). The uprising could only be suppressed with
heavy deployment of military forces in which more than 300
rebels were killed and even more wounded and imprisoned.
The upsurge seems to have been the product more of
discontent than of actual grievance—the elements of discontent
lying in the very nature of the alien administration.
Upsurge in Hathras (1817)
Dayaram, a talukdar of several villages in the district of
Aligarh, had a strong base in the fort of Hathras. The fort,
considered to be among the strongest in India—a ‘second
Bharatpur’—had walls of great height, and thickness, defended
by a deep ditch and artillery mounted at the top. The English
had concluded the settlement of Hathras estate with Dayaram
as a farmer. But due to progressively increasing high
revenues, Dayaram constantly failed to pay arrears and even
committed many acts of hostility by giving harbour to
government fugitives. So, the Company with a large army
attacked Hathras in February 1817. Dayaram fought bravely
for more than 15 days and escaped unharmed. But, ultimately,
he was obliged to come back on condition of submission
and settled down with a pension. Another noted rebel
Bhagwant Singh, Raja of Mursan, frightened to dismantle his
fort, submitted to the government.
Paika Rebellion (1817)
The Paiks of Odisha were the traditional landed militia (‘foot
soldiers’ literally) and enjoyed rent free land tenures for their
military service and policing functions on a hereditary basis.
The English Company’s conquest of Odisha in 1803, and the
dethronement of the Raja of Khurda had greatly reduced the
power and prestige of the Paiks. Further, the extortionist land
revenue policy of the Company caused resentment among
zamindars and peasants alike. Common masses were affected
by the rise in prices of salt due to taxes imposed on it,
abolition of cowrie currency and the requirement of payment
of taxes in silver, etc.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  149

Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar had been the military
chief of the forces of the Raja of Khurda. In 1814,
Jagabandhu’s ancestral estate of Killa Rorang was taken over
by the Company, reducing him to penury. The spark was
lighted by the arrival of a body of Khonds from Gumsur into
the Khurda territory in March 1817. With active support of
Mukunda Deva, the last Raja of Khurda, and other zamindars
of the region, Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar led a sundry army
of Paikas forcing the East India Company forces to retreat
for a time. The rebellion came to be known as the Paika
Bidroh (rebellion). The initial success of the rebels set the
whole province covering Odisha in arms against the British
government for some time. Jagabandhu, declared an outlaw,
along with other rebels, was sheltered by the Raja of
Nayagarh. Although Dinabandhu Santra and his group
surrendered in November 1818, Jagabandhu evaded British
vigilance. In spite of rewards offered, none of the people
of the province betrayed their leaders. Though Khurda was
back under Company control by mid-1817, the Paika rebels
resorted to guerilla tactics. The rebellion was brutally
repressed by 1818. Priests at the Puri temple who had
sheltered Jagabandhu were caught and hanged. Paiks on the
whole suffered greatly. In 1825 Jagabandhu surrendered
under negotiated terms. (Some sources say he was captured
and died in captivity in 1829).
The Paik Rebellion succeeded in getting large remissions
of arrears, reductions in assessments, suspension of the sale
of the estates of defaulters at discretion, a new settlement
on fixed tenures and other adjuncts of a liberal governance.
Waghera Rising (1818-1820)
Resentment against the alien rule coupled with the exactions
of the Gaekwad of Baroda supported by the British government
compelled the Waghera chiefs of Okha Mandal to take up
arms. The Wagheras carried out inroads into British territory
during 1818-19. A peace treaty was signed in November
1820.
Ahom Revolt (1828)
The British had pledged to withdraw from Assam after the
First Burma War (1824-26). But, after the war, instead of

150  

withdrawing, the British attempted to incorporate the Ahoms’
territories in the Company’s dominion. This sparked off a
rebellion in 1828 under the leadership of Gomdhar Konwar,
an Ahom prince, alongwith compatriots, such as Dhanjoy
Bongohain, and Jairam Khargharia Phukan. Assembling near
Jorhat, the rebels formally made Gomdhar Konwar the king.
Finally, the Company decided to follow a conciliatory policy
and handed over Upper Assam to Maharaja Purandar Singh
Narendra and part of the kingdom was restored to the
Assamese king.
Surat Salt Agitations (1840s)
A strong anti-British sentiment resulted in attacks by the
local Surat population on the Europeans in 1844 over the
issue of the government’s step to raise the salt duty from
50 paise to one rupee. Faced with a popular movement, the
government withdrew the additional salt levy. Again in 1848,
the government was forced to withdraw its measure to
introduce Bengal Standard Weights and Measures in face of
people’s determined bid to resort to boycott and passive
resistance.
Kolhapur and Savantvadi Revolts
The Gadkaris were a hereditary military class which was
garrisoned in the Maratha forts. These garrisons were disbanded
during administrative reorganisation in Kolhapur state after
1844. Facing the spectre of unemployment, the Gadkaris rose
in revolt and occupied the Samangarh and Bhudargarh forts.
Similarly, the simmering discontent caused a revolt in
Savantvadi areas. The people here had already revolted against
the British in 1830, 1836 and 1838, the last because the
British had deposed their ruler. The British authorities
introduced many laws to bring the region under control.
Wahabi Movement
The Wahabi Movement was essentially an Islamic revivalist
movement founded by Syed Ahmed of Rai Bareilly who was
inspired by the teachings of Abdul Wahab (1703-87) of Saudi
Arabia and Shah Waliullah of Delhi. Syed Ahmed condemned
the western influence on Islam and advocated a return to pure
Islam and society as it was in the Arabia of the Prophet’s
time.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  151

Syed Ahmed was acclaimed as the desired leader
(Imam). A countrywide organisation with an elaborate secret
code for its working under spiritual vice-regents (Khalifas)
was set up, and Sithana in the north-western tribal belt was
chosen as a base for operations. In India, its important centre
was at Patna though it had its missions in Hyderabad, Madras,
Bengal, United Provinces and Bombay. Since Dar-ul-Harb
(territory of War or Chaos) was to be converted into Darul-Islam (the land of Islam), a jihad was declared against the
Sikh kingdom of Punjab. After the defeat of the Sikh ruler
and incorporation of Punjab into the East India Company’s
dominion in 1849, the English dominion in India became the
sole target of the Wahabis’ attacks.
The Wahabis played an important role in spreading antiBritish sentiments. A series of military operations by the
British in the 1860s on the Wahabi base in Sithana and
various court cases of sedition on the Wahabis weakened the
Wahabi resistance, although sporadic encounters with the
authorities continued into the 1880s and 1890s.
Kuka Movement
The Kuka Movement was founded in 1840 by Bhagat Jawahar
Mal (also called Sian Saheb) in western Punjab. A major
leader of the movement after him was Baba Ram Singh. (He
founded the Namdhari Sikh sect.) After the British took
Punjab, the movement got transformed from a religious
purification campaign to a political campaign. Its basic tenets
were abolition of caste and similar discriminations among
Sikhs, discouraging the consumption of meat and alcohol and
drugs, permission for intermarriages, widow remarriage, and
encouraging women to step out of seclusion. On the political
side, the Kukas wanted to remove the British and restore Sikh
rule over Punjab; they advocated wearing hand-woven clothes
and boycott of English laws and education and products. So,
the concepts of Swadeshi and non-cooperation were propagated
by the Kukas, much before they became part of the Indian
national movement in the early twentieth century. As the
movement gained in popularity, the British took several steps
to crush it in the period between 1863 and 1872.
In 1872, Ram Singh was deported to Rangoon.

152  

Peasant Movements with
Religious Overtones
Peasant uprisings were protests against evictions, increase in
rents of land, and the moneylenders’ greedy ways; and their
aim was occupancy rights for peasants among other things.
They were revolts and rebellions of the peasants themselves
though led by local leaders in many cases. The peasant
movements in India till the outbreak of the Revolt of 1857
(and in its immediate aftermath) are given below.
Narkelberia Uprising
Mir Nithar Ali (1782-1831) or Titu Mir inspired the Muslim
tenants in West Bengal to rise against landlords, mainly
Hindu, who imposed a beard-tax on the Faraizis, and British
indigo planters. Often considered the first armed peasant
uprising against the British, these revolt soon took on a
religious hue. The revolt later merged into the Wahabi
movement.
The Pagal Panthis
The Pagal Panthi, a semi-religious group mainly constituting
the Hajong and Garo tribes of Mymensingh district (earlier
in Bengal), was founded by Karam Shah. But the tribal
peasants organised themselves under Karam Shah’s son, Tipu,
to fight the oppression of the zamindars. From 1825 to 1835,
the Pagal Panthis refused to pay rent above a certain limit
and attacked the houses of zamindars. The government
introduced an equitable arrangement to protect these peasants,
but the movement was violently suppressed.
Faraizi Revolt
The Faraizis were the followers of a Muslim sect founded
by Haji Shariat-Allah of Faridpur in Eastern Bengal. They
advocated radical religious, social and political changes.
Shariat-Allah son of Dadu Mian (1819-60) organised his
followers with an aim to expel the English intruders from
Bengal. The sect also supported the cause of the tenants
against the zamindars. The Faraizi disturbances continued
from 1838 to 1857. Most of the Faraizis joined the Wahabi
ranks.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  153

Moplah Uprisings
Hike in revenue demand and reduction of field size, coupled
with the oppression of officials, resulted in widespread
peasant unrest among the Moplahs of Malabar. Twenty-two
rebellions took place between 1836 and 1854. None, however,
proved successful.
(The second Moplah uprising occurred after the Moplahs
came to be organised by the Congress and the Khilafat
supporters during the Non-cooperation Movement. But HinduMuslim differences distanced the Congress and the Moplahs
from each other. By 1921, the Moplahs had been subdued.)
Peasants’ Role in the 1857 Revolt
Peasant participation was active only in some areas affected
by the 1857 rebellion, mainly those in western Uttar Pradesh.
Moreover, the peasants united with the local feudal leaders
in many places to fight against foreign rule. After the revolt,
the plight of the peasants worsened with the British
Government’s decision to gain the support of the landed
classes while ignoring the peasants. Occupancy peasants’
interests suffered. In Avadh, for instance, land was restored
to the taluqdars and they were given revenue and other powers
as well, and the peasants could not avail of the provisions
of the 1859 Bengal Rent Act. As a punishment for their
participation in the 1857 revolt, the peasants had to pay an
additional cess in some regions.

Tribal Revolts
Tribal movements under British rule were the most frequent,
militant and violent of all movements.

Different Causes for Mainland and
North-Eastern Tribal Revolts

The tribal movements can be analysed better if categorised
into mainland tribal revolts and frontier tribal revolts
concentrated mainly in the north-eastern part of India.
The mainland tribal rebellions were sparked off by a
number of factors, an important one concerned with the tribal
lands or forests.
The land settlements of the British affected the joint

154  

ownership tradition among the tribals and disrupted their
social fabric.
As agriculture was extended in a settled form by the
Company government, the tribals lost their land, and there
was an influx of non-tribals to these areas.
Shifting cultivation in forests was curbed and this added
to the tribals’ problems. The government further extended its
control over the forest areas by setting up reserved forests
and restricting timber use and grazing. This was the result
of the increasing demand from the Company for timber—
for shipping and the railways.
Exploitation by the police, traders and money-lenders
(most of them ‘outsiders’) aggravated the tribals’ sufferings.
Some general laws were also abhorred for their intrusive
nature as the tribals had their own customs and traditions.
With the expansion of colonialism, Christian
missionaries came to these regions and their efforts interfered
with the traditional customs of the tribals. The missionaries,
perceived as representatives of the alien rule, were resented
by the tribals.
The movements of the tribes of the north-eastern
frontier were different from the non-frontier tribal revolts
in some aspects.
For one thing, the tribes which shared tribal and cultural
links with countries across the border did not concern
themselves much with the nationalist struggle. Their revolts
were often in favour of political autonomy within the Indian
Union or complete independence.
Secondly, these movements were not forest-based or
agrarian revolts as these tribals were generally in control of
land and forest area. The British entered the north-eastern
areas much later than the non-frontier tribal areas.
Thirdly, the frontier tribal revolts under the British
continued for a longer time than the non-frontier tribal
movements. De-sanskritisation movements also spread among
the frontier tribals. The Meiteis organised a movement during
Churchand Maharaja’s rule (between 1891 and 1941) to
denounce the malpractices of the neo-Vaishnavite Brahmins.
Sanskritisation movements were almost totally absent in the
north-east frontier region in the colonial period.

Characteristics of Tribal Revolts

There were some common characteristics of the tribal
uprisings even though they were separated from one another
in time and space.
● Tribal identity or ethnic ties lay behind the solidarity
shown by these groups. Not all ‘outsiders’ were, however,
seen as enemies: the poor who lived by their manual labour
or profession and had a socially/economically supportive role
in the village were left alone; the violence was directed
towards the money-lenders and traders who were seen as
extensions of the colonial government.
● A common cause was the resentment against the
imposition of laws by the ‘foreign government’ that was seen
as an effort at destroying the tribals’ traditional socioeconomic framework.
● Many uprisings were led by messiah-like figures who
encouraged their people to revolt and who held out the
promise that they could end their suffering brought about by
the ‘outsiders’.
● The tribal uprisings were doomed from the beginning,
given the outdated arms they fought with as against the
modern weapons and techniques used by their opponents.

Important Tribal Movements of Mainland

Some important tribal movements are discussed below. It
may be noted that most tribal movements, if we leave out
the frontier tribal areas, were concentrated in central India,
the west-central region and the south.
Pahariyas’ Rebellion
The British expansion on their territory led to an uprising
by the martial Pahariyas of the Raj Mahal Hills in 1778. The
British were forced to usher in peace by declaring their
territory as damni-kol area.
Chuar Uprising
Famine, enhanced land revenue demands and economic
distress goaded the Chuar aboriginal tribesmen of the Jungle
Mahal of Midnapore district and also of the Bankura district
(in Bengal) to take up arms.
These tribes people were basically farmers and hunters.

156  

The uprising lasted from 1766 to 1772 and then, again
surfaced between 1795 and 1816. The Chuars were prominent
in Manbhum and Barabhum, especially in the hills between
Barabhum and Ghatsila. They held their lands under a kind
of feudal tenure, but were not strongly attached to the soil,
being always ready to change from farming to hunting, at the
bidding of their jungle chiefs or zamindars. In 1768, Jagannath
Singh, the zamindar of Ghatsila, went up in arms, alongwith
thousands of Chuars. The Company government capitulated.
In 1771, the Chuar sardars, Shyam Ganjan of Dhadka, Subla
Singh of Kaliapal and Dubraj rose in rebellion. This time,
however, they were suppressed.
The most significant uprising was under Durjan (or
Durjol) Singh in 1798. Durjan Singh was the zamindar of
Raipur from which he was dispossessed owing to the
operations of Bengal Regulations. In May 1798, his followers,
a body of 1,500 Chuars, indulged in violent activities in
Raipur to halt the auction of the estate of Raipur. The revolt
was brutally suppressed by the British. Other leaders of the
Chuars were Madhab Singh, the brother of the raja of
Barabhum, Raja Mohan Singh, zamindar of Juriah and Lachman
Singh of Dulma.
(The term ‘Chuar’ is considered derogatory by some
historians who call this the Revolt of the Jungle Mahal,
instead.)
Kol Mutiny (1831)
The Kols, alongwith other tribes, are inhabitants of
Chhotanagpur. This covered Ranchi, Singhbhum, Hazaribagh,
Palamau and the western parts of Manbhum. The trouble in
1831 started with large-scale transfers of land from Kol
headmen to outsiders like Hindu, Sikh and Muslim farmers
and money-lenders who were oppressive and demanded heavy
taxes. Besides, the British judicial and revenue policies badly
affected the traditional social conditions of the Kols. The
Kols resented this and in 1831, under the leadership of
Buddho Bhagat, the Kol rebels killed or burnt about a
thousand outsiders. Only after large-scale military operations
could order be restored.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  157

Ho and Munda Uprisings (1820-1837)
The Raja of Parahat organised his Ho tribals to revolt against
the occupation of Singhbhum (now in Jharkhand). The revolt
continued till 1827 when the Ho tribals were forced to
submit. However, later in 1831, they again organised a
rebellion, joined by the Mundas of Chotanagpur, to protest
against the newly introduced farming revenue policy and the
entry of Bengalis into their region. Though the revolt was
extinguished in 1832, the Ho operations continued till 1837.
Nor were the Mundas to be quiet for long.
[In 1899-1900, the Mundas in the region south of
Ranchi rose under Birsa Munda. The Ulgulan was one of
the most significant tribal uprisings in the period 1860-1920.
The rebellion which began as a religious movement gathered
political force to fight against introduction of feudal, zamindari
tenures, and exploitation by money-lenders and forest
contractors. The Mundas claimed Chhotanagpur as their area
in 1879. British armed forces were then deployed. Birsa was
captured and imprisoned.]
The Santhal Rebellion (1855-56)
Continued oppression of the Santhals, an agricultural people,
who had fled to settle in the plains of the Rajmahal hills
(Bihar) led to the Santhal rebellion against the zamindars. The
money-lenders who had the support of the police among
others had joined the zamindars to subject the peasants to
oppressive exactions and dispossession of lands. The rebellion
turned into an anti-British movement. Under Sidhu and Kanhu,
two brothers, the Santhals proclaimed an end to Company
rule, and declared the area between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal
as autonomous. The rebellion was suppressed by 1856.
Khond Uprisings (1837-1856)
From 1837 to 1856, the Khonds of the hilly tracts extending
from Odisha to the Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts
of Andhra Pradesh revolted against Company rule. Chakra
Bisoi, a young raja, led the Khonds who were joined by the
Ghumsar, Kalahandi and other tribals to oppose the suppression
of human sacrifice, new taxes, and the entry of zamindars
into their areas. With Chakra Bisoi’s disappearance, the
uprising came to an end.

158  

[A later Khond rebellion in 1914 in the Orissa region
was triggered by the hope that foreign rule would end and
they could gain an autonomous government.]
Koya Revolts
The Koyas of the eastern Godavari track (modern Andhra),
joined by Khonda Sara chiefs, rebelled in 1803, 1840, 1845,
1858, 1861 and 1862. They rose once again in 1879-80
under Tomma Sora. Their complaints were oppression by
police and moneylenders, new regulations and denial of their
customary rights over forest areas. After the death of Tomma
Sora, another rebellion was organised in 1886 by Raja
Anantayyar.
Bhil Revolts
The Bhils who lived in the Western Ghats controlled the
mountain passes between the north and the Deccan. They
revolted against Company rule in 1817-19, as they had to
face famine, economic distress and misgovernment. The
British used both force and conciliatory efforts to control
the uprising. However, the Bhils revolted again in 1825, 1831
and in 1846. Later, a reformer, Govind Guru helped the Bhils
of south Rajasthan (Banswara, Sunth states) to organise
themselves to fight for a Bhil Raj by 1913.
Koli Risings
The Kolis living in the neighbourhood of Bhils rose up in
rebellion against the Company’s rule in 1829, 1839 and again
during 1844-48. They resented the imposition of Company’s
rule which brought with it large-scale unemployment for
them and the dismantling of their forts.
Ramosi Risings
The Ramosis, the hill tribes of the Western Ghats, had not
reconciled to British rule and the British pattern of
administration. They resented the policy of annexation. After
the annexation of the Maratha territories by the British, the
Ramosis, who had been employed by the Maratha
administration, lost their means of livelihood. They rose
under Chittur Singh in 1822 and plundered the country around
Satara. Again, there were eruptions in 1825-26 under Umaji
Naik of Poona and his supporter Bapu Trimbakji Sawant, and

Finally, a superior British force restored order in the area.
Generally the British followed a pacifist policy towards the
Ramosis, and even recruited some of them into the hill
police.

Tribal Movements of the North-East

Some famous tribal movements of the north-east frontier
region have been given below.
Khasi Uprising
After having occupied the hilly region between Garo and
Jaintia Hills, the East India Company wanted to build a road
linking the Brahmaputra Valley with Sylhet. For this, a large
number of outsiders including Englishmen, Bengalis and the
labourers from the plains were brought to these regions. The
Khasis, Garos, Khamptis and the Singphos organised
themselves under Tirath Singh to drive away the strangers
from the plains. The uprising developed into a popular revolt
against British rule in the area. By 1833, the superior English
military force had suppressed the revolt.

(a) led by Parikshit Jamatia (1863)
(b) the Reangs’ revolt led by Ratnamani (1942-43)
(c) led by Bharti Singh (1920s)

Liangmei and Rongmei tribes; against the failure of British to
protect them during the Kuki violence in 1917-19.
4. Naga movement (1905-31; Manipur); led by Jadonang; against
British rule and for setting up of a Naga raj.
5. Heraka Cult (1930s; Manipur); led by Gaidinliu; the movement

1946.
6. Other Smaller Movements were the revolt of the Syntengs

1861, the revolt of the Saflas in 1872-73; the uprising of the
Kacha Nagas of Cachhar in 1882; and a women’s war in Manipur
in 1904.

Singphos Rebellion
The rebellion of the Singphos in Assam in early 1830 was
immediately quelled but they continued to organise revolts.
An uprising in 1839 saw the death of the British political
agent. Chief Nirang Phidu led an uprising in 1843, which
involved an attack on the British garrison and the death of
many soldiers.

162  

Some of the smaller movements were those of the
Mishmis (in 1836); the Khampti rebellion in Assam between
1839 and 1842; the Lushais’ revolt in 1842 and 1844, when
they attacked villages in Manipur.

Sepoy Mutinies
A number of sporadic military uprisings took place before
the Great Revolt of 1857 in different parts of the country.

Causes

There was rising discontent of the sepoys against the British
rule due to the following reasons:
(i) discrimination in payment and promotions;
(ii) mistreatment of the sepoys by the British officials;
(iii) refusal of the government to pay foreign service
allowance while fighting in remote regions;
(iv) religious objections of the high caste Hindu
sepoys to Lord Canning’s General Service
Enlistment Act (1856) ordering all recruits to be
ready for service both within and outside India.
Further, the sepoys shared all the discontent and
grievances—social, religious and economic—that afflicted
the civilian population.
Over the years, the upper caste sepoys had found their
religious beliefs in conflict with their service conditions. For
example, in 1806, the replacement of the turban by a leather
cockade caused a mutiny at Vellore. Similarly in 1844, there
was a mutinous outbreak of the Bengal army sepoys for being
sent to far away Sind and in 1824 the sepoys at Barrackpore
rose in revolt when they were asked to go to Burma because
crossing the sea would mean loss of caste.

Important Mutinies

The most important mutinies which broke out during the pre1857 period are the following:
(i) The mutiny of the sepoys in Bengal in 1764.
(ii) The Vellore mutiny of 1806 when the sepoys protested
against interference in their social and religious
practices and raised a banner of revolt unfurling the
flag of the ruler of Mysore.

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857  163

(iii) The mutiny of the sepoys of the 47th Native Infantry
Unit in 1824.
(iv) The revolt of the Grenadier Company in Assam in
1825.
(v) The mutiny of an Indian regiment at Sholapur in 1838.
(vi) The mutinies of the 34th Native Infantry (N.I.), the
22nd N.I., the 66th N.I. and the 37th N.I. in 1844,
1849, 1850 and 1852 respectively.
However, all these mutinies did not spread beyond their
locality and were ruthlessly crushed by the British Indian
government, often inflicting terrible violence, executing
leaders and disbanding the regiments. But the legacy of these
revolts proved to be of immense significance later.

Weaknesses of People’s
Uprisings
● These uprisings drew a large number of participants
but were, in fact, localised and occurred at different times
in different regions.
● They mostly arose out of local grievances.
● The leadership was semi-feudal in character, backwardlooking, traditional in outlook and their resistance did not
offer alternatives to the existing social set-up.
● If many of these revolts seemed similar to one
another in wanting to oust the alien rule, it was not because
of some ‘national’ impulse or common effort, but because
they were protesting against conditions that were common
to them.
● These rebellions were centuries-old in form and
ideological / cultural content.
● Those who were not so uncooperative or obstinate
were pacified through concessions by the authorities.
● The methods and arms used by the fighters in these
uprisings were practically obsolete compared to the weapons
and strategy—as well as deception and chicanery—employed
by their opponents.

Chapter 7

The Revolt of 1857
In 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, the British laid the first
step towards getting power in northern India. And in 1857
took place the major ‘Revolt’ which was a product of the
character and policies of colonial rule after 1757, and after
which noteworthy changes took place in the British policy
of ruling over India.

Simmering Discontent
The cumulative effect of British expansionist policies,
economic exploitation and administrative innovations over
the years had adversely affected the positions of all—rulers
of Indian states, sepoys, zamindars, peasants, traders, artisans,
pundits, maulvis, etc. The simmering discontent burst in the
form of a violent storm in 1857 which shook the British
empire in India to its very foundations.
However, the period between 1757 and 1857 was not
all peaceful and trouble-free; it saw a series of sporadic
popular outbursts in the form of religio-political violence,
tribal movements, peasant uprisings and agrarian riots, and
civil rebellions. Enhanced revenue demands—even in famine
years—caused anger. Many a times, movements against local
moneylenders turned into rebellion against the Company rule
as the moneylenders had the support of the police. British
interference in native religious/traditional customs also caused
167

168  

resentment and resulted in rebellions. Almost from the very
early days of the East India Company’s rule, rebellions and
uprisings occurred for various causes in different regions.
Some of the movements continued even after the 1857
Revolt. Major revolts took place in the south, east, west and
the north-eastern regions which were suppressed with brutality
by the Company.
[The previous chapter discussed some of these uprisings.]

The 1857 Revolt: the
Major Causes
The causes of the revolt of 1857, like those of earlier
uprisings, emerged from all aspects—socio-cultural, economic
and political—of daily existence of Indian population cutting
through all sections and classes. These causes are discussed
below.

Economic Causes

The colonial policies of the East India Company destroyed
the traditional economic fabric of the Indian society. The
peasantry were never really to recover from the disabilities
imposed by the new and a highly unpopular revenue settlement.
Impoverished by heavy taxation, the peasants resorted to
loans from money-lenders/traders at usurious rates, the latter
often evicting the former from their land on non-payment
of debt dues. These money-lenders and traders emerged as
the new landlords, while the scourge of landless peasantry
and rural indebtedness has continued to plague Indian society
to this day. The older system of zamindari was forced to
disintegrate.
British rule also meant misery to the artisans and
handicrafts people. The annexation of Indian states by the
Company cut off their major source of patronage—the native
rulers and the nobles, who could not now afford to be patrons
of the crafts workers. Added to this, British policy discouraged
Indian handicrafts and promoted British goods. The highly
skilled Indian craftsmen were forced to look for alternate
sources of employment that hardly existed, as the destruction
of Indian handicrafts was not accompanied by the development
of modern industries.

The Revolt of 1857  169
View
It was the British intruder who broke up the Indian handloom
and destroyed the spinning-wheel. England began with depriving
the Indian cottons from the European market; it then introduced
twist into Hindustan and in the end inundated the very mother
country of cotton with cottons.”
—Karl Marx, in 1853

The Indian trade and mercantile class was deliberately
crippled by the British who imposed high tariff duties on
Indian-made goods. At the same time, the import of British
goods into India attracted low tariffs, thus encouraging their
entry into India. By mid-nineteenth century, exports of cotton
and silk textiles from India practically came to an end. Free
trade—one way, that is—and refusal to impose protective
duties against machine-made goods from Britain simply
killed Indian manufacture.
Zamindars, the traditional landed aristocracy, often saw
their land rights forfeited with frequent use of a quo
warranto by the administration. This resulted in a loss of
status for them in the villages. In Awadh, the storm centre
of the revolt, 21,000 taluqdars had their estates confiscated
and suddenly found themselves without a source of income,
“unable to work, ashamed to beg, condemned to penury”.
These dispossessed taluqdars seized the opportunity presented
by the sepoy revolt to oppose the British and try to regain
what they had lost.
The ruin of Indian industry increased the pressure on
agriculture and land, which could not support all the people;
the lopsided development resulted in pauperisation of the
country in general.

Political Causes

The East India Company’s greedy policy of aggrandisement
accompanied by broken pledges and promises resulted in
contempt for the Company and loss of political prestige,
besides causing suspicion in the minds of almost all the
ruling princes in India, through such policies as of ‘Effective
Control’, ‘Subsidiary Alliance’ and ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. The
right of succession was denied to Hindu princes. The Mughals
were humbled when, on Prince Faqiruddin’s death in 1856,
whose succession had been recognised conditionally by Lord
Dalhousie, Lord Canning announced that the next prince on

170  

succession would have to renounce the regal title and the
ancestral Mughal palaces, in addition to the renunciations
agreed upon by Prince Faqiruddin.
The collapse of rulers—the erstwhile aristocracy—also
adversely affected those sections of the Indian society which
derived their sustenance from cultural and religious pursuits.

Administrative Causes

Rampant corruption in the Company’s administration,
especially among the police, petty officials and lower law
courts, was a major cause of discontent. Indeed, it is the view
of many historians that the rampant corruption we see now
in India is a legacy of the Company rule. Also, the character
of British rule imparted a foreign and alien look to it in the
eyes of Indians: a kind of absentee sovereignty.

Socio-Religious Causes

Racial overtones and a superiority complex characterised the
British administrative attitude towards the native Indian
population. The activities of Christian missionaries who
followed the British flag in India were looked upon with
suspicion by Indians. The attempts at socio-religious reform
such as abolition of sati, support to widow-marriage and
women’s education were seen by a large section of the
population as interference in the social and religious domains
of Indian society by outsiders. These fears were compounded
by the government’s decision to tax mosque and temple lands
and making laws such as the Religious Disabilities Act, 1856,
which modified Hindu customs, for instance, declaring that
a change of religion did not debar a son from inheriting the
property of his ‘heathen’ father.

Influence of Outside Events

The revolt of 1857 coincided with certain outside events in
which the British suffered serious losses—the First Afghan
War (1838-42), Punjab Wars (1845-49), and the Crimean
Wars (1854-56). These had obvious psychological
repercussions. The British were seen to be not so strong and
it was felt that they could be defeated.

Discontent Among Sepoys

The conditions of service in the Company’s Army and
cantonments increasingly came into conflict with the religious

The Revolt of 1857  171

beliefs and prejudices of the sepoys. Restrictions on wearing
caste and sectarian marks and secret rumours of proselytising
activities of the chaplains (often maintained on the Company’s
expenses which meant at Indian expense) were interpreted
by Indian sepoys, who were generally conservative by nature,
as interference in their religious affairs.
To the religious Hindu of the time, crossing the seas
meant loss of caste. In 1856, Lord Canning’s government
passed the General Service Enlistment Act which decreed that
all future recruits to the Bengal Army would have to give
an undertaking to serve anywhere their services might be
required by the government. This caused resentment.
The Indian sepoy was equally unhappy with his emoluments compared to his British counterpart. A more immediate
cause of the sepoys’ dissatisfaction was the order that they
would not be given the foreign service allowance (bhatta)
when serving in Sindh or in Punjab. The annexation of Awadh,
home of many of the sepoys, further inflamed their feelings.
The Indian sepoy was made to feel a subordinate at
every step and was discriminated against racially and in
matters of promotion and privileges. The discontent of the
sepoys was not limited to military matters; it reflected the
general disenchantment with and the opposition to British
rule. The sepoy, in fact, was a ‘peasant in uniform’ whose
consciousness was not divorced from that of the rural
population. “The Army voiced grievances other than its own;
and the movement spread beyond the Army”, observes S.
Gopal.
Finally, there had been a long history of revolts in the
British Indian Army—in Bengal (1764), Vellore (1806),
Barrackpore (1825) and during the Afghan Wars (1838-42)
to mention just a few.

Beginning and Spread of the
Revolt
The Spark

The reports about the mixing of bone dust in atta (flour)
and the introduction of the Enfield rifle enhanced the sepoys’

172  

growing disaffection with the government. The greased
wrapping paper of the cartridge of the new rifle had to be
bitten off before loading and the grease was reportedly made
of beef and pig fat. The cow was sacred to the Hindus while
the pig was taboo for the Muslims. The Army administration
did nothing to allay these fears, and the sepoys felt their
religion was in grave danger.
The greased cartridges did not create a new cause of
discontent in the Army, but supplied the occasion for the
simmering discontent to come out in the open.

Starts at Meerut

The revolt began at Meerut, 58 km from Delhi, on May 10,
1857 and then, gathering force rapidly, soon embraced a vast
area from the Punjab in the north and the Narmada in the
south to Bihar in the east and Rajputana in the west.
Even before the Meerut incident, there were rumblings
of resentment in various cantonments. The 19th Native
Infantry at Berhampore (West Bengal), which refused to use
the newly introduced Enfield rifle and broke out in mutiny
in February 1857 was disbanded in March 1857. A young
sepoy of the 34th Native Infantry, Mangal Pande, went a
step further and fired at the sergeant major of his unit at
Barrackpore. He was overpowered and executed on April 8
while his regiment was disbanded in May. The 7th Awadh
Regiment which defied its officers on May 3 met with a
similar fate.
And then came the explosion at Meerut. On April 24,
ninety men of the 3rd Native Cavalry refused to accept the
greased cartridges. On May 9, eighty-five of them were
dismissed, sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and put in
fetters. This sparked off a general mutiny among the Indian
soldiers stationed at Meerut. The very next day, on May 10,
they released their imprisoned comrades, killed their officers
and unfurled the banner of revolt. They set off for Delhi after
sunset.

Choice of Bahadur Shah as
Symbolic Head

In Delhi, the local infantry joined them, killed their own
European officers including Simon Fraser, the political agent,

The Revolt of 1857  173

and seized the city. Lieutenant Willoughby, the officer-incharge of the magazine at Delhi, offered some resistance,
but was overcome. The aged and powerless Bahadur Shah
Zafar was proclaimed the Emperor of India.
Delhi was soon to become the centre of the Great
Revolt and Bahadur Shah, its symbol. This spontaneous
raising of the last Mughal king to the leadership of the
country was a recognition of the fact that the long reign of
Mughal dynasty had become the traditional symbol of India’s
political unity. With this single act, the sepoys had transformed
a mutiny of soldiers into a revolutionary war, while all Indian
chiefs who took part in the revolt hastened to proclaim their
loyalty to the Mughal emperor. It also signified that the
rebels were politically motivated. Though religion was a
factor, the broad outlook of the rebels was not influenced
by religious identity but by the perception of the British as
the common enemy.
Bahadur Shah, after initial vacillation, wrote letters to
all the chiefs and rulers of India urging them to organise a
confederacy of Indian states to fight and replace the British
regime. The entire Bengal Army soon rose in revolt which
spread quickly. Awadh, Rohilkhand, the Doab, Bundelkhand,
central India, large parts of Bihar and East Punjab shook off
British authority.

Civilians Join

The revolt of the sepoys was accompanied by a rebellion of
the civil population, particularly in the north-western provinces
and Awadh. Their accumulated grievances found immediate
expression and they rose en masse to give vent to their
opposition to British rule. It is the widespread participation
in the revolt by the peasantry, the artisans, shopkeepers, day
labourers, zamindars, religious mendicants, priests and civil
servants which gave it real strength as well as the character
of a popular revolt. Here the peasants and petty zamindars
gave free expression to their grievances by attacking the
money-lenders and zamindars who had displaced them from
the land. They took advantage of the revolt to destroy the
money-lenders’ account books and debt records. They also
attacked the British-established law courts, revenue offices
(tehsils), revenue records and police stations.

174  

According to one estimate, of the total number of about
1,50,000 men who died fighting the English in Awadh, over
1,00,000 were civilians.
Within a month of the capture of Delhi by the rebels,
the revolt spread to different parts of the country.

Storm Centres and Leaders of the Revolt

At Delhi the nominal and symbolic leadership belonged to
the Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, but the real command
lay with a court of soldiers headed by General Bakht Khan
who had led the revolt of Bareilly troops and brought them
to Delhi. The court consisted of ten members, six from the
army and four from the civilian departments. The court
conducted the affairs of the state in the name of the emperor.
Emperor Bahadur Shah was perhaps the weakest link in the
chain of leadership of the revolt. His weak personality, old
age and lack of leadership qualities created political weakness
at the nerve centre of the revolt and did incalculable damage
to it.
At Kanpur, the natural choice was Nana Saheb, the
adopted son of the last peshwa, Baji Rao II. He was refused
the family title and banished from Poona, and was living near
Kanpur. Nana Saheb expelled the English from Kanpur,
proclaimed himself the peshwa, acknowledged Bahadur Shah
as the Emperor of India and declared himself to be his
governor. Sir Hugh Wheeler, commanding the station,
surrendered on June 27, 1857 and was killed on the same
day.
Begum Hazrat Mahal took over the reigns at Lucknow
where the rebellion broke out on June 4, 1857 and popular
sympathy was overwhelmingly in favour of the deposed
nawab. Her son, Birjis Qadir, was proclaimed the nawab and
a regular administration was organised with important offices
shared equally by Muslims and Hindus. Henry Lawrence, the
British resident, the European inhabitants and a few hundred
loyal sepoys took shelter in the residency. The residency was
besieged by the Indian rebels and Sir Henry was killed during
the siege. The command of the besieged garrison devolved
on Brigadier Inglis who held out against heavy odds. The early
attempts of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram to

The Revolt of 1857  175

recover Lucknow met with no success. Finally, Sir Colin
Campbell, the new commander-in-chief, evacuated the
Europeans with the help of Gorkha regiments. In March 1858,
the city was finally recovered by the British, but guerrilla
activity continued till September of the same year.
At Bareilly, Khan Bahadur, a descendant of the former
ruler of Rohilkhand, was placed in command. Not enthusiastic
about the pension being granted by the British, he organised
an army of 40,000 soldiers and offered stiff resistance to
the British.
In Bihar, the revolt was led by Kunwar Singh, the
zamindar of Jagdishpur. An old man in his seventies, he
nursed a grudge against the British who had deprived him of
his estates. He unhesitatingly joined the sepoys when they
reached Arrah from Dinapore (Danapur).
Maulvi Ahmadullah of Faizabad was another
outstanding leader of the revolt. He was a native of Madras
and had moved to Faizabad in the north where he fought a
stiff battle against the British troops. He emerged as one of
the revolt’s acknowledged leaders once it broke out in Awadh
in May 1857.
The most outstanding leader of the revolt was Rani
Laxmibai, who assumed the leadership of the sepoys at
Jhansi. Lord Dalhousie, the governor-general, had refused to
allow her adopted son to succeed to the throne after her
husband Raja Gangadhar Rao died, and had annexed the state
by the application of the infamous ‘Doctrine of Lapse’.
Driven out of Jhansi by British forces, she gave the battle
cry—”main apni Jhansi nahin doongi” (I shall not give
away my Jhansi). She was joined by Tantia Tope, a close
associate of Nana Saheb, after the loss of Kanpur. The Rani
of Jhansi and Tantia Tope marched towards Gwalior where
they were hailed by the Indian soldiers. The Sindhia, the local
ruler, however, decided to side with the English and took

who defeated her)

shelter at Agra. Nana Saheb was proclaimed the Peshwa and
plans were chalked out for a march into the south. Gwalior
was recaptured by the English in June 1858.
The sacrifices made by the common masses were
immense and innumerable. The name of Shah Mal, a local
villager in Pargana Baraut (Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh), is most
notable. He organised the headmen and peasants of 84
villages (referred as chaurasi desh), marching at night from
village to village, urging people to rebel against the British
hegemony. The people attacked government buildings,
destroyed the bridges over the rivers and dug up metalled
roads—partially to stop government forces from coming into
the area, and partly because bridges and roads were viewed
as symbols of British rule. Shah Mal sent supplies to the
mutineers in Delhi and prevented all official communication
between British headquarters and Meerut. He made his
headquarters at the bungalow of an irrigation department on
the banks of the Yamuna and supervised and controlled his
operations from there. In fact, the bungalow was turned into
a “hall of justice”, resolving disputes and dispensing judgments.
He also organised an effective network of intelligence for
a short duration, the people of the area felt that the British
rule was over, and their own rule had come. Unfortunately,
in July 1857, Shah Mal was killed by an English officer,
Dunlap. It is alleged that Shah Mal’s body was cut into pieces
and his head displayed on July 21, 1857 to terrify the public.
For more than a year, however, the rebels carried on their
struggle against heavy odds.

Suppression of the Revolt
The revolt was finally suppressed. The British captured Delhi
on September 20, 1857 after prolonged and bitter fighting.
John Nicholson, the leader of the siege, was badly wounded
and later succumbed to his injuries. Bahadur Shah was taken
prisoner. The royal princes were captured and butchered on
the spot, publicly shot at point blank range by Lieutenant
Hudson himself. The emperor was exiled to Rangoon where
he died in 1862. Thus the great House of Mughals was finally
and completely extinguished. Terrible vengeance was wreaked

The Revolt of 1857  177

on the inhabitants of Delhi. With the fall of Delhi the focal
point of the revolt disappeared.
One by one, all the great leaders of the revolt fell.
Military operations for the recapture of Kanpur were closely
associated with the recovery of Lucknow. Sir Colin Campbell
occupied Kanpur on December 6, 1857. Nana Saheb, defeated
at Kanpur, escaped to Nepal in early 1859, never to be heard
of again. His close associate Tantia Tope escaped into the
jungles of central India, but was captured while asleep in April
1859 and put to death. The Rani of Jhansi had died on the
battlefield earlier in June 1858. Jhansi was recaptured by Sir
Hugh Rose. By 1859, Kunwar Singh, Bakht Khan, Khan
Bahadur Khan of Bareilly, Rao Sahib (brother of Nana Saheb)
and Maulvi Ahmadullah were all dead, while the Begum of
Awadh was compelled to hide in Nepal. At Benaras, a
rebellion had been organised which was mercilessly suppressed
by Colonel Neill, who put to death all suspected rebels and
even disorderly sepoys.
By the end of 1859, British authority over India was
fully re-established. The British government had to pour
immense supplies of men, money and arms into the country,
though the Indians had to later repay the entire cost through
their own suppression.

Why the Revolt Failed
All-India participation was absent

Limited territorial spread was one factor; there was no allIndia veneer about the revolt. The eastern, southern and
western parts of India remained more or less unaffected. This
was probably because the earlier uprisings in those regions
had been brutally suppressed by the Company.

All classes did not join

Certain classes and groups did not join and, in fact, worked
against the revolt.
Big zamindars acted as “break-waters to storm”; even
Awadh taluqdars backed off once promises of land restitution
were spelt out. Money-lenders and merchants suffered the
wrath of the mutineers badly and anyway saw their class
interests better protected under British patronage.

178  

Educated Indians viewed this revolt as backward looking,
supportive of the feudal order and as a reaction of traditional
conservative forces to modernity; these people had high
hopes that the British would usher in an era of modernisation.
Most Indian rulers refused to join, and often gave active
help to the British. Rulers who did not participate included
the Sindhia of Gwalior, the Holkar of Indore, the rulers of
Patiala, Sindh and other Sikh chieftains and the Maharaja of
Kashmir. Indeed, by one estimate, not more than one-fourth
of the total area and not more than one-tenth of the total
population was affected.

Poor Arms and Equipment

The Indian soldiers were poorly equipped materially, fighting
generally with swords and spears and very few guns and
muskets. On the other hand, the European soldiers were
equipped with the latest weapons of war like the Enfield rifle.
The electric telegraph kept the commander-in-chief informed
about the movements and strategy of the rebels.

Uncoordinated and Poorly Organised

The revolt was poorly organised with no coordination or
central leadership. The principal rebel leaders—Nana Saheb,
Tantia Tope, Kunwar Singh, Laxmibai—were no match to
their British opponents in generalship. On the other hand, the
East India Company was fortunate in having the services of
men of exceptional abilities in the Lawrence brothers, John
Nicholson, James Outram, Henry Havelock, etc.

No Unified Ideology

The mutineers lacked a clear understanding of colonial rule;
nor did they have a forward looking programme, a coherent
ideology, a political perspective or a societal alternative. The
rebels represented diverse elements with differing grievances
and concepts of current politics.
The lack of unity among Indians was perhaps unavoidable
at this stage of Indian history. Modern nationalism was as
yet unknown in India. In fact, the revolt of 1857 played an
important role in bringing the Indian people together and
imparting to them the consciousness of belonging to one
country.

The Revolt of 1857  179

Hindu-Muslim Unity Factor
During the entire revolt, there was complete cooperation
between Hindus and Muslims at all levels—people, soldiers,
leaders. All rebels acknowledged Bahadur Shah Zafar, a
Muslim, as the emperor and the first impulse of the Hindu
sepoys at Meerut was to march to Delhi, the Mughal imperial
capital. According to Maulana Azad, “Two facts stand out
clearly in the midst of the tangled story of the Rising of
1857. The first is the remarkable sense of unity among the
Hindus and the Muslims of India in this period. The other
is the deep loyalty which the people felt for the Mughal
Crown.” Rebels and sepoys, both Hindu and Muslim, respected
each other’s sentiments. Immediate banning of cow slaughter
was ordered once the revolt was successful in a particular
area. Both Hindus and Muslims were well represented in
leadership, for instance Nana Saheb had Azimullah, a Muslim
and an expert in political propaganda, as an aide, while
Laxmibai had the solid support of Afghan soldiers.
Thus, the events of 1857 demonstrated that the people
and politics of India were not basically communal or
sectarian before 1858.

Nature of the Revolt
Views differ on the nature of the 1857 revolt. It was a mere
‘Sepoy Mutiny’ to some British historians—“a wholly
unpatriotic and selfish Sepoy Mutiny with no native leadership
and no popular support”, said Sir John Seeley. However, that
is not a complete picture of the event as it involved many
sections of the civilian population and not just the sepoys.
The discontent of the sepoys was just one cause of the
disturbance.
Dr K. Datta considers the revolt of 1857 to have been
“in the main a military outbreak, which was taken advantage
of by certain discontented princes and landlords, whose
interests had been affected by the new political order”. The
last mentioned factor gave it an aura of a popular uprising
in certain areas. It was “never all-Indian in character, but was
localised, restricted and poorly organised”. Further, says
Datta, the movement was marked by absence of cohesion and

180  

unity of purpose among the various sections of the rebels.
It was at the beginning of the twentieth century that
the 1857 revolt came to be interpreted as a “planned war
of national independence”, by V.D. Savarkar in his book, The
Indian War of Independence, 1857. Savarkar called the
revolt the first war of Indian independence. He said it was
inspired by the lofty ideal of self rule by Indians through
a nationalist upsurge. Dr S.N. Sen in his Eighteen FiftySeven considers the revolt as having begun as a fight for
religion but ending as a war of independence.
Dr R.C. Majumdar, however, considers it as neither the
first, nor national, nor a war of independence as large parts
of the country remained unaffected and many sections of the
people took no part in the upsurge.
According to some Marxist historians, the 1857 revolt
was “the struggle of the soldier-peasant democratic combine
against foreign as well as feudal bondage”. However, this view
can be questioned in the light of the fact that the leaders
of the revolt themselves came from a feudal background.
Jawaharlal Nehru considered the revolt of 1857 as
essentially a feudal uprising though there were some
nationalistic elements in it (Discovery of India). M.N. Roy
felt the revolt was a last ditch stand of feudalism against
commercial capitalism. R.P. Dutt also saw the significance
of the revolt of the peasantry against foreign domination
even as he acknowledged it to be a defence of the old feudal
order.
The revolt of 1857 is not easy to categorise. While
one can easily dismiss some views such as those of L.E.R.
Rees who considered it to be a war of fanatic religionists
against Christians or T.R. Holmes who saw in it a conflict
between civilisation and barbarism, one cannot quite go so
far as to accept it as a war for independence. It had seeds
of nationalism and anti-imperialism but the concept of
common nationality and nationhood was not inherent to the
revolt of 1857.
It is doubtful if the separate communities that
participated in the revolt did so because they felt a common
nationhood. Furthermore, what of the southern section which
was not a part of the revolt? Each of the leaders had a

1857 stands firmly in a historical continuum. Not of course it
was the direct product of social forces blowing off the political
crust but rather fortuitous conjuncture that laid these forces bane.
Like 1848 in Europe—despite obvious disparities—it was on
uprising sans issue that could catch a society moving into the
early stages of modernisation.

First War of Independence it certainly was, as in the whole
canvas of the recorded history of India it would be difficult to
find a parallel to this gigantic anti-foreign combine of all classes
of people and of many provinces of India. There was never a
war in India lasting continuously for more than a year and
simultaneously in all the regions which had for its objective the
abasement and ejectment of the alien ruling power.
S.B. Chaudhuri
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the so-called First
National War of Independence of 1857 is neither First, nor
National, nor War of Independence.
R.C. Majumdar
It has to be admitted that the war against the British was not
inspired by any sentiment of nationalism, for in 1857 India was
not yet politically a nation. It is a fact that the Hindus and
Muslims cooperated, but the leaders and the followers of the
two communities were moved by personal loyalties rather than
loyalty to a common motherland.

personal cause for revolting; each had a personal interest to
protect. However, as Dr Sen points out, national revolutions
are mostly the work of a minority, with or without the active
support of the masses. From that point of view, the 1857
rebellion can claim a national character.
One may say that the revolt of 1857 was the first great
struggle of Indians to throw off British rule. Even this view
has been questioned by some historians who feel that some
of the earlier uprisings had been equally serious efforts at
throwing off the foreign yoke, but have not got the same kind
of attention. However, S.B. Chaudhuri observes, the revolt
was “the first combined attempt of many classes of people
to challenge a foreign power. This is a real, if remote,
approach to the freedom movement of India of a later age”.

of Delhi and a section of the landed aristocracy and civil
population decided in his favour. What began as a fight for religion
ended as a war of independence.

Consequences
The revolt of 1857 marks a turning point in the history of
India. It led to far-reaching changes in the system of
administration and the policies of the British government.
Even before the Revolt could be suppressed fully, the
British Parliament, on August 2, 1858, passed an Act for the
Better Government of India. The Act declared Queen Victoria
as the sovereign of British India and provided for the
appointment of a Secretary of State for India (a member of
the British cabinet). The direct responsibility for the
administration of the country was assumed by the British
Crown and Company rule was abolished.
The assumption of the Government of India by the
sovereign of Great Britain was announced by Lord Canning
at a durbar at Allahabad in the ‘Queen’s Proclamation’ issued
on November 1, 1858. (It was by this proclamation that the
governor-general acquired the additional title of ‘Viceroy’.)

The Revolt of 1857  183

Many of the promises made in that proclamation appeared
to be of a positive nature to the Indians.
As per the Queen’s proclamation, the era of annexations
and expansion had ended and the British promised to respect
the dignity and rights of the native princes.
The Indian states were henceforth to recognise the
paramountcy of the British Crown and were to be treated as
parts of a single charge.
The people of India were promised freedom of religion
without interference from British officials.
The proclamation also promised equal and impartial
protection under law to all Indians, besides equal opportunities
in government services irrespective of race or creed. It was
also promised that old Indian rights, customs and practices
would be given due regard while framing and administering
the law.
The Army, which was at the forefront of the outbreak,
was thoroughly reorganised and British military policy came
to be dominated by the idea of “division and counterpoise”.
The British could no longer depend on Indian loyalty, so the
number of Indian soldiers was drastically reduced even as
the number of European soldiers was increased. The concept
of divide and rule was adopted with separate units being
created on the basis of caste/community/region. Recruits
were to be drawn from the ‘martial’ races of Punjab, Nepal,
and north-western frontier who had proved loyal to the British
during the Revolt. Effort was made to keep the army away
from civilian population.
The Army Amalgamation Scheme, 1861 moved the
Company’s European troops to the services of the Crown.
Further, the European troops in India were constantly revamped
by periodical visits to England, sometimes termed as the
‘linked-battalion’ scheme. All Indian artillery units, except a
few mountain batteries, were made defunct. All higher posts
in the army and the artillery departments were reserved for
the Europeans. Till the first decade of the twentieth century,
no Indian was thought fit to deserve the king’s commission
and a new English recruit was considered superior to an
Indian officer holding the viceroy’s commission.
The earlier reformist zeal of a self-confident Victorian

184  

liberalism evaporated as many liberals in Britain began to
believe that Indians were beyond reform. This new approach—
‘conservative brand of liberalism’, as it was called by Thomas
Metcalf—had the solid support of the conservative and
aristocratic classes of England who espoused the complete
non-interference in the traditional structure of Indian society.
Thus the era of reforms came to an end.
The conservative reaction in England made the British
Empire in India more autocratic; it began to deny the
aspirations of the educated Indians for sharing power. In the
long term, this new British attitude proved counter-productive
for the Empire, as this caused frustrations in the educated
Indian middle classes and gave rise to modern nationalism
very soon.
The policy of divide and rule started in earnest after
the Revolt of 1857. The British used one class/community
White Mutiny
In the wake of the transfer of power from the British East India
Company to the British Crown, a section of European forces
employed under the Company resented the move that required the
three Presidency Armies to transfer their allegiance from the defunct
Company to the Queen, as in the British Army. This resentment
resulted in some unrest termed as White Mutiny.
Prior to 1861, there were two separate military forces in India,
operating under the British rule. One was the Queen’s army and
the other comprised the units of the East India Company. The
Company’s troops received batta, extra allowances of pay to cover
various expenditures related to operations in areas other than the
home territories. With transfer of power, the batta was stopped.
Lord Canning’s legalistic interpretation of the laws surrounding the
transfer also infuriated the affected White soldiers.
The White Mutiny was seen as a potential threat to the already
precarious British position in India with a potential of inciting renewed
rebellion among the ‘still excited population in India’. The demands
of the ‘European Forces’ included an enlistment bonus or a choice
of release from their obligations. Finally, the demand for free and
clear release with free passage home was accepted, and men opted
to return home. It is also believed that open rebellion and physical
violence on the part of ‘European Forces’ were such that there
was little possibility of being accepted into the ‘Queen’s Army’.

against another unscrupulously. Thus, socially, there was
irremediable deterioration. While British territorial conquest
was at an end, a period of systematic economic loot by the
British began. The Indian economy was fully exploited
without fear.
In accordance with Queen’s Proclamation of 1858, the
Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 was passed, which was to
give an impression that under the Queen all were equal,
irrespective of race or creed. (In reality, the detailed rules
framed for the conduct of the civil service examination had
the effect of keeping the higher services a close preserve
of the colonisers.)
Racial hatred and suspicion between the Indians and the
English was probably the worst legacy of the revolt. The
newspapers and journals in Britain picturised the Indians as
subhuman creatures, who could be kept in check only by
superior force. The proponents of imperialism in India
dubbed the entire Indian population as unworthy of trust and
subjected them to insults and contempt. The complete
structure of the Indian government was remodelled and based
on the notion of a master race—justifying the philosophy
of the ‘Whiteman’s burden’. This widened the gulf between
the rulers and the ruled, besides causing eruptions of political
controversies, demonstrations and acts of violence in the
coming period.

Significance of the Revolt
For the British the Revolt of 1857 proved useful in that it
showed up the glaring shortcomings in the Company’s
administration and its army, which they rectified promptly.
These defects would never have been revealed to the world
if the Revolt had not happened.
For the Indians, the 1857 Revolt had a major influence

186  

on the course of the struggle for freedom. It brought out
in the open grievances of people and the sepoys, which were
seen to be genuine. However, it was also obvious that the
primitive arms which the Indians possessed were no match
for the advanced weapons of the British. Furthermore, the
senseless atrocities committed by both sides shocked the
Indian intellectuals who were increasingly convinced that
violence was to be eschewed in any struggle for freedom.
The educated middle class, which was a growing section, did
not believe in violence and preferred an orderly approach.
But the Revolt of 1857 did establish local traditions of
resistance to British rule which were to be of help in the
course of the national struggle for freedom.
Summary
Revolt—a product of character and policies of colonial rule.
Economic causes—heavy taxation under new revenue settlement,
summary evictions, discriminatory tariff policy against Indian
products, destruction of traditional handicrafts industry, and
absence of concomitant industrialisation on modern lines that
hit peasants, artisans and small zamindars.
Political causes—greedy policy of aggrandisement, absentee
sovereigntyship character of British rule, British interference in
socio-religious affairs of Indian public.
Military causes—discontent among sepoys for economic,
psychological and religious reasons, coupled with a long history
of revolts.

Factors Giving Rise to
Desire for Reform
The dawn of the nineteenth century witnessed the birth of
a new vision—a modern vision among some enlightened
sections of the Indian society. This enlightened vision was
to shape the course of events for decades to come and even
beyond. This process of reawakening, sometimes, but not
with full justification, defined as the ‘Renaissance’, did not
always follow the intended line and gave rise to some
undesirable by-products as well, which have become as much
188

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  189

a part of daily existence in the whole of the Indian subcontinent
as have the fruits of these reform movements.

Impact of British Rule

The presence of a colonial government on Indian soil played
a complex, yet decisive role in this crucial phase of modern
Indian history. The impact of British rule on Indian society
and culture was widely different from what India had known
before. Most of the earlier invaders, who had come to India
settled within its frontiers, were either absorbed by its
superior culture or interacted positively with it and had
become part of the land and its people. However, the British
conquest was different. It came at a time when India, in
contrast to an enlightened Europe of the eighteenth century
affected in every aspect by science and scientific outlook,
presented the picture of a stagnant civilisation and a static
and decadent society.

Social Conditions Ripe for Reform
Religious and Social Ills
Indian society in the nineteenth century was caught in a
vicious web created by religious superstitions and social
obscurantism. Hinduism had become steeped in magic and
superstition. The priests exercised an overwhelming and,
indeed, unhealthy influence on the minds of the people.
Idolatry and polytheism helped to reinforce their position,
and their monopoly of scriptural knowledge imparted a
deceptive character to all religious systems. There was
nothing that religious ideology could not persuade people to
do.
Depressing Position of Women
Social conditions were equally depressing. The most
distressing was the position of women. Attempts to kill
female infants at birth were not unusual. Child marriage was
another bane of society. The practice of polygamy prevailed
and in Bengal, under Kulinism, even old men took very young
girls as wives. Several women hardly had a married life worth
the name, yet (at least among the higher castes) when their
husbands died they were expected to commit sati which Raja

190  

Rammohan Roy described as a “murder according to every
shastra”. If they escaped this social coercion, they were
condemned to a life of misery and humiliation.
The Caste Problem
Another debilitating factor was caste. This entailed a system
of segregation, hierarchically ordained on the basis of ritual
status. At the bottom of the ladder came the untouchables
or scheduled castes, as they came to be called later. The
untouchables suffered from numerous and severe disabilities
and restrictions. The system splintered people into numerous
groups. In modern times it became a major obstacle in the
growth of a united national feeling and the spread of
democracy. It may also be noted that caste consciousness,
particularly with regard to marriage, prevailed also among
Muslims, Christians and Sikhs who also practised
untouchability, though in a less virulent form. Under a rigid
caste system, social mobility was checked, social divisions
grew, and individual initiative was thwarted. Above all, the
humiliation of untouchability—so much a part of the caste
system—militated against human dignity.

Opposition to Western Culture

The establishment of colonial rule in India was followed by
a systematic attempt to disseminate colonial culture and
ideology as the dominant cultural current. Faced with the
challenge of the intrusion of colonial culture and ideology,
an attempt to reinvigorate traditional institutions and to
realise the potential of traditional culture developed during
the nineteenth century.

New Awareness among Enlightened
Indians

The impact of modern Western culture and consciousness
of defeat by a foreign power gave birth to a new awakening.
There was an awareness that a vast country like India had been
colonised by a handful of foreigners because of weaknesses
within the Indian social structure and culture. For some time
it seemed that India had lagged behind in the race of
civilisation. This produced diverse reactions. Some Englisheducated Bengali youth developed a revulsion for Hindu

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  191

religion and culture, gave up old religious ideas and traditions
and deliberately adopted practices most offensive to Hindu
sentiments, such as drinking wine and eating beef. The
response, indeed, was varied but the need to reform social
and religious life was a commonly shared conviction.
During the last decades of the nineteenth century, the
rising tide of nationalism and democracy also found expression
in movements to reform and democratise the social
institutions and religious outlook of the Indian people.
Factors such as growth of nationalist sentiments, emergence
of new economic forces, spread of education, impact of
modern Western ideas and culture and increased awareness
of the world strengthened the resolve to reform.
The socio-cultural regeneration of the India of the
nineteenth century was occasioned by the colonial presence,
but not created by it.

Social and Ideological Bases of
Reform
Middle Class Base
The social base of the regeneration seen in the nineteenth
century was the newly emerging middle class and the
educated (both traditionally educated and the Western educated)
intellectuals, but there was a significant contrast between the
broadly middle class ideals derived from a growing awareness
of contemporary developments in the West, and a
predominantly non-middle class social base.
The nineteenth century intelligentsia searched for its
model in the European ‘middle class’, which, as it learnt
through Western education, had brought about the great
transformation in the West from medieval to modern times
through movements like the Renaissance, the Reformation,
the Enlightenment and democratic revolution or reform.
However, the intelligentsia of nineteenth century India did
not grow from trade or industry (which were firmly under
the control of British agencies); their roots lay in government
service or the professions of law, education, journalism or

192  

medicine—with which was often combined some connection
with land in the form of the intermediate tenures.

The Intellectual Criteria

What gave these reform movements an ideological unity were
rationalism, religious universalism and humanism. Rationalism
was brought to judge social relevance. Raja Rammohan Roy
firmly believed in the principle of causality linking the whole
phenomenal universe and demonstrability as the sole criterion
of truth. Akshay Kumar Dutt, while declaring that “rationalism
is our only preceptor”, held that all natural and social
phenomena could be analysed and understood by purely
mechanical processes. They thus used a rational approach to
study tradition; they evaluated the contemporary socioreligious practices from the standpoint of social utility and
to replace faith with rationality. As a consequence, in the
Brahmo Samaj the infallibility of the Vedas was repudiated,
while the Aligarh movement emphasised reconciliation of
Islamic teachings with the needs of the modern age. Syed
Ahmed Khan went to the extent of emphasising that religious
tenets were not immutable.
Many of the intellectuals set aside the authority of
religion and evaluated truth in any religion by the criteria
of logic, reason or science. According to Swami Vivekananda,
the same method of investigation which applies to sciences
should be the basis on which religion must justify itself.
Although some reformers tended to appeal to faith and
ancient authority to support their appeal, on the whole, a
rational and secular outlook was very much evident in putting
forward an alternative to prevalent social practices. Akshay
Kumar Dutt, for instance, brought medical opinion to support
his views against child marriage. Reference to the past was
to be used only as an aid and an instrument. Neither a revival
of the past nor a total break with tradition was envisaged.
Though the reformers tried to reform their religions,
there was a universalistic aspect to their religious perspective.
Raja Rammohan Roy considered different religions as national
embodiments of universal theism. He defended the basic and
universal principles of all religions—such as the monotheism
of the Vedas and unitarianism of Christianity—while attacking

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  193

the polytheism of Hinduism and trinitarianism of Christianity.
Syed Ahmed Khan said that all prophets had the same ‘din’
(faith) and every country and nation had different prophets.
The social reformers used the universalist perspective
to contend with the influence of religious identity on the
social and political outlook of the people which was indeed
strong.
A new humanitarian morality was embodied in the
social reform movements which included the notion that
humanity can progress and has progressed, and that moral
values are ultimately those values which favour human
progress. The humanist aspect of the religious reform
movements was to be seen in the emphasis on the individual’s
right to interpret religious scriptures in the light of human
reason and human welfare and in a general attack on priestly
domination of religious practices.
Religious reformation was an important but not the
exclusive concern of these movements. Attention was
focussed on worldly existence and not on issues of salvation
or other worldliness. Because of the strong religious element
in social practices and the fact that religion was the dominant
ideology of the times, it was not possible to undertake any
social action without coming to grips with it.
These movements took into their ambit the entire
cultural existence, the way of life. The evolution of an
alternative cultural-ideological system and the regeneration
of traditional institutions were two concerns of these
movements. These concerns were manifest in the attempts
to reconstruct traditional knowledge, the use and development
of vernacular languages, creation of an alternative system of
education, defence of religion, efforts to regenerate Indian
art and literature, the emphasis on Indian dress and food,
attempts to revitalise the Indian systems of medicine and to
research the pre-colonial technology for its potential.

Two Streams

The reform movements could broadly be classified into two
categories—the reformist movements like the Brahmo Samaj,
the Prarthana Samaj, the Aligarh Movement, and the revivalist
movements like Arya Samaj and the Deoband movement. The

194  

reformist as well as the revivalist movement depended, to
varying degrees, on an appeal to the lost purity of the religion
they sought to reform. The only difference between one
reform movement and the other lay in the degree to which
it relied on tradition or on reason and conscience.

Direction of Social Reform
The humanistic ideals of social equality and the equal worth
of all individuals which inspired the newly educated middle
class influenced the field of social reform in a major way.
The social reform movements were linked to the religious
reforms primarily because nearly all social ills like
untouchability and gender-based inequity derived legitimacy
from religion in one way or the other. In later years, though,
the social reform movement gradually dissociated itself from
religion and adopted a secular approach. Moreover, earlier
the reform movements had a rather narrow social base, being
limited to the upper and middle classes and upper castes who
tried to balance their modernised views and the existing
social conditions. But later on, the social reform movements
penetrated the lower strata of society to revolutionise and
reconstruct the social sphere.
In the beginning, organisations such as the Social
Conference, Servants of India Society and the Christian
missionaries were instrumental in social reform along with
many enlightened individuals like Jyotiba Phule, Gopalhari
Deshmukh, K.T. Telang, B.M. Malabari, D.K. Karve, Sri
Narayana Guru, E.V. Ramaswami Naicker and B.R. Ambedkar.
In later years, especially with the onset of the twentieth
century, the national movement provided the leadership and
organisation for social reform.
To reach the masses, the reformers used the Indian
languages to propagate their views. They used a variety of
media—novels, dramas, poetry, short stories, the press and,
in the 1930s and later on, the cinema—to spread their
opinions.
Broadly, the social reform movements had a two-point
agenda—fight for the betterment of status of women in

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  195

society and fight to remove disabilities arising out of
untouchability.

Fight for Betterment of Position
of Women

The reformers had to work against great odds. Women were
generally accorded a low status and were considered to be
inferior adjuncts to men, with no identity of their own. They
enjoyed no scope of giving expression to their talents as they
were suppressed by practices such as purdah, early marriage,
ban on widow-marriage, sati, etc. Both Hindu and Muslim
women were economically and socially dependent on male
relatives, while education was generally denied to them. The
Hindu women did not enjoy the right to inherit property or
to terminate an undesirable marriage. Muslim women could
inherit property but only half as much as men could, while
in matters of divorce there was no equality between men and
women. Polygamy was prevalent among Hindus as well as
Muslims.
Their glorification as wives and mothers was the only
way in which society recognised the contribution of women
as members of society. The improvement of the status of
women in the society was considered to be vital, and social
reformers worked towards this since a radical change in the
domestic sphere—where initial socialisation of the individual
takes place and where a crucial role is played by women—
was the need of the hour. It was clearly understood that this
change would translate into reformed homes and reformed
men, and that no country whose females were sunk in
ignorance could ever make significant progress in civilisation.
The social reform movements, the freedom struggle,
movements led by enlightened women themselves and, later,
free India’s Constitution have done much for the emancipation
of women.
The reformers basically appealed to the doctrines of
individualism and equality, and argued, to bolster their appeal,
that true religion did not sanction an inferior status to women.
They raised their voice against degrading customs such as
polygamy, purdah, child marriage, restrictions on widow
marriage, and worked relentlessly to establish educational

196  

facilities for women, to persuade the government to enact
favourable legislations for women and in general to propagate
the uselessness of medieval, feudal attitudes which required
to be given up.
Steps taken to Ameliorate Women’s Position
Because of the indefatigable efforts of the reformers, a
number of administrative measures were adopted by the
government to improve the condition of women.
Abolition of Sati Influenced by the frontal attack
launched by the enlightened Indian reformers led by Raja
Rammohan Roy, the government declared the practice of sati
illegal and punishable by criminal courts as culpable homicide.
The regulation of 1829 (Regulation XVII, A.D. 1829 of the
Bengal Code) was applicable in the first instance to Bengal
Presidency alone, but was extended in slightly modified
forms to Madras and Bombay Presidencies in 1830.
Preventing Female Infanticide The practice of
murdering female infants immediately after their birth was
a common practice among upper class Bengalis and Rajputs
who considered females to be an economic burden. The
Bengal regulations of 1795 and 1804 declared infanticide
illegal and equivalent to murder. An Act passed in 1870 made
it compulsory for parents to register the birth of all babies
and provided for verification of female children for some
years after birth, particularly in areas where the custom was
resorted to in utmost secrecy.
Widow Remarriage The Brahmo Samaj had the issue
of widow remarriage high on its agenda and did much to
popularise it. But it was mainly due to the efforts of Pandit
Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820-91), the principal of Sanskrit College, Calcutta, that the Hindu Widows’ Remarriage
Act, 1856, was passed; it legalised marriage of widows and
declared issues from such marriages as legitimate. Vidyasagar
cited Vedic texts to prove that the Hindu religion sanctioned
widow remarriage.
Jagannath Shankar Seth and Bhau Daji were among the
active promoters of girls’ schools in Maharashtra. Vishnu
Shastri Pandit founded the Widow Remarriage Association
in the 1850s. Another prominent worker in this field was

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  197

Karsondas Mulji who started the Satya Prakash in Gujarati
in 1852 to advocate widow remarriage. Similar efforts were
made by Professor D.K. Karve in western India and by
Veerasalingam Pantulu in Madras. Karve himself married a
widow in 1893. He dedicated his life to the upliftment of
Hindu widows and became the secretary of the Widow
Remarriage Association. He opened a widows’ home in
Poona to give the high caste widows an interest in life by
providing them with facilities for vocational training. The
right of widows to remarriage was also advocated by B.M.
Malabari, Narmad (Narmadashankar Labhshankar Dave), Justice
Govind Mahadeo Ranade and K. Natarajan among others.
Controlling Child Marriage The Native Marriage
Act (or Civil Marriage Act), 1872 signified legislative action
in prohibiting child marriage. It had a limited impact as the
Act was not applicable to Hindus, Muslims and other
recognised faiths. The relentless efforts of a Parsi reformer,
B.M. Malabari, were rewarded by the enactment of the Age
of Consent Act (1891) which forbade the marriage of girls
below the age of 12. The Sarda Act (1930) further pushed
up the marriage age to 18 and 14 for boys and girls,
respectively. In free India, the Child Marriage Restraint
(Amendment) Act, 1978 raised the age of marriage for girls
from 15 to 18 years and for boys from 18 to 21.
Education of Women The Christian missionaries were
the first to set up the Calcutta Female Juvenile Society in
1819. The Bethune School, founded by J.E.D. Bethune,
president of the Council of Education in Calcutta in 1849
was the first fruit of the powerful movement for women’s
education that arose in the 1840s and 1850s. Pandit Ishwar
Chandra Vidyasagar was associated with no less than 35 girls’
schools in Bengal and is considered one of the pioneers of
women’s education.
Charles Wood’s Despatch on Education (1854) laid
great stress on the need for female education. In 1914, the
Women’s Medical Service did a lot of work in training nurses
and mid-wives. The Indian Women’s University set up by
Professor D.K. Karve in 1916 was one of the outstanding
institutions imparting education to women. In the same year
Lady Hardinge Medical College was opened in Delhi.

198  

Health facilities began to be provided to women with
the opening of Dufferin Hospitals in the 1880s.
Participation in the swadeshi and anti-partition and the
Home Rule movements during the opening decades of the
twentieth century was a major liberating experience for the
otherwise home-centred Indian women. After 1918, they
faced lathis and bullets and were jailed during political
processions, picketing, etc. They actively participated in trade
union and kisan movements, or revolutionary movements.
They voted in, stood for and got elected to various legislatures
and local bodies. Sarojini Naidu went on to become the
president of the Indian National Congress (1925) and later
the governor of the United Provinces (1947-49).
After 1920, aware and self-confident women led a
women’s movement. Many organisations and institutions such
as the All India Women’s Conference (established in 1927)
came up.
Women’s Organisations In 1910, Sarla Devi
Chaudhurani convened the first meeting of the Bharat Stree
Mahamandal in Allahabad. Considered as the first major
Indian women’s organisation set up by a woman, its objectives
included promotion of education for women, abolition of the
purdah system and improvement in the socio-economic and
political status of woman all over India. Sarla Devi believed
that the man working for women’s upliftment lived ‘under
the shade of Manu’.
Ramabai Ranade founded the Ladies Social Conference
(Bharat Mahila Parishad), under the parent organisation
National Social Conference, in 1904 in Bombay.
Pandita Ramabai Saraswati founded the Arya Mahila
Samaj to serve the cause of women. She pleaded for
improvement in the educational syllabus of Indian women
before the English Education Commission which was referred
to Queen Victoria. This resulted in medical education for
women which started in Lady Dufferin College. Later Ramabai
Ranade established a branch of Arya Mahila Samaj in
Bombay.
In 1925, the National Council of Women in India, a
national branch of the International Council of Women, was

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  199

formed. Mehribai Tata played a vital role in its formation
and advancement. She opined that the purdah system, caste
differences and lack of education prevented women from
working to solve societal problems. Other women who held
important positions on the executive committee of the
council included Cornelia Sarabji, India’s first lady barrister;
Tarabai Premchand, wife of a wealthy banker; Shaffi Tyabji,
a member of one of Mumbai’s leading Muslim families; and
Maharani Sucharu Devi, daughter of Keshab Chandra Sen.
However, according to critics, the philanthropic style that was
being followed by these women was that of upper-class
English women.
The All India Women’s Conference (AIWC), founded
by Margaret Cousins in 1927, was perhaps the first women’s
organisation with an egalitarian approach. Its first conference
was held at Ferguson College, Pune. Important founding
members included Maharani Chimnabai Gaekwad, Rani Sahiba
of Sangli, Sarojini Naidu, Kamla Devi Chattopadhyaya and
Lady Dorab Tata. Its objectives were to work for a society
based on principles of social justice, integrity, equal rights
and opportunities; and to secure for every human being, the
essentials of life, not determined by accident of birth or sex
but by planned social distribution. For this purpose, the AIWC
worked towards various legislative reforms before and after
India’s independence, some examples being Sarda Act (1929),
Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act (1937), Factory Act
(1947), Hindu Marriage and Divorce Act (1954), Special
Marriage Act (1954), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act
(1956), Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (1956), the
Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women Act (1958),
Maternity Benefits Act (1961), Dowry Prohibition Act
(1961) and Equal Remuneration Act (1958, 1976).

Struggle Against Caste-Based Exploitation
The later-Vedic conception of four-fold division of Hindu
society got further subdivided into numerous sub-castes due
to racial admixture, geographical expansion and diversification
of crafts which gave rise to new vocations.
The concept of Hindu chaturvarnashrama dictated that
the caste of a person determined the status and relative purity

200  

of different sections of population. It was caste that determined
who could get education or ownership of landed property,
the kind of profession one should pursue, whom one could
dine with or marry, etc. In general, caste decided a person’s
social loyalties even before birth. The dress, food, place of
residence, sources of water for drinking and irrigation, entry
into temples—all these were regulated by the caste factor.
The worst-hit by the discriminatory institution of caste
were the ‘untouchables’ or the scheduled castes/dalits, as they
came to be called later. The disabilities imposed on them
were humiliating, inhuman and based on the principle of
inequality by birth.
Factors that Helped to Mitigate Caste-based
Discrimination
● British rule, perhaps without intention, created
certain conditions that undermined caste consciousness
to an extent. British rule in India unleashed certain forces,
sometimes through direct administrative measures and
sometimes indirectly by creating suitable conditions. Though
these measures had negative effects in one way, they had a
positive effect too. For instance, the creation of private
property in land and free sale of land upset caste equations.
A close interlink between caste and vocation could not
survive as village autarchy crumbled. Besides, modern
commerce and industry gave rise to several economic
avenues while growing urbanisation and modern means of
transport added to the mobility of populations. The British
administration introduced the concept of equality before law
in a uniformly applied system of law which dealt a severe
blow to social and legal inequalities, while the judicial
functions of caste panchayats were taken away. The
administrative services were made open to all castes and the
new education system was on totally secular lines.
● The social reform movements also strove to
undermine caste-based exploitation. From the mid-19th
century onwards, numerous organisations and groups such as
the Brahmo Samaj, Prarthana Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna
Mission, the Theosophists, the Social Conference and
individuals worked to spread education among the untouchables

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  201

and remove restrictions imposed on them from entering
temples or using ponds, tanks, etc. Although many of them
defended the chaturvarna system, they criticised
untouchability. The social reformers attacked the rigid
hereditary basis of caste distinctions and the law of karma
which formed the basis of the religio-philosophic defence
of the undemocratic authoritarian caste institution. They
called on people to work for betterment in the real world
in which they lived, rather than strive for salvation after death.
For instance, the Arya Samaj while crusading against the
disintegration of Hindu society into myriad sub-castes, aimed
at reconstructing it on the original four-fold division and
upholding the right of even the lowest castes to study the
scriptures.
● The national movement took inspiration from the
principles of liberty and equality against the forces
which tended to divide the society. The national leaders
and organisations opposed caste privileges, fought for equal
civic rights and free development of the individual. The caste
divisions were diluted, although in a limited manner, because
of mass participation in demonstrations, meetings and
satyagraha struggles. The Congress governments in various
provinces after 1937 did some useful work for the upliftment
of the depressed classes; for instance, free education for
Harijans (‘untouchables’) was introduced in some provinces.
The rulers of states like Travancore, Indore and Devas took
the initiative in opening all state temples by proclamation.
Gandhi always had in mind the objective of eradicating
untouchability by root and branch. His ideas were based on
the grounds of humanism and reason. He argued that the
Shastras did not sanction untouchability and, even if they
did, they should be ignored since truth cannot be confined
within the covers of a book. In 1932, he founded the All
India Harijan Sangh.
● With increasing opportunities of education and
general awakening, there were stirrings among the
lower castes themselves. This awakening gradually developed
into a powerful movement in defence of their rights and
against upper caste oppression. In Maharashtra, Jyotiba Phule,

202  

born in a low caste Mali family, led a movement against the
brahminical domination of Hindu society. He accorded the
highest priority to education of lower castes, especially girls
for whom he opened several schools.
Babasaheb Ambedkar, who had experienced the worst
form of casteist discrimination during his childhood, fought
against upper caste tyranny throughout his life. He organised
the All India Scheduled Castes Federation, while several other
leaders of the depressed classes founded the All India
Depressed Classes Association. Ambedkar condemned the
hierarchical and insular caste system as a whole, and advocated
the annihilation of the institution of caste for the real
progress of the nation. The struggle of the depressed classes
led to the provision of special representation for these
classes in the Government of India Act, 1935.
Others in the 1900s, such as the Maharaja of Kolhapur,
encouraged the non-brahmin movement which spread to the
southern states in the first decade of the twentieth century
and was joined by the Kammas, Reddis, Vellalas (the
powerful intermediate castes) and the Muslims.
During the 1920s in South India, the non-brahmins
organised the Self-Respect Movement led by E.V. Ramaswamy
Naicker. There were numerous other movements demanding
that the ban on the entry of lower castes into temples be
lifted. Sri Narayana Guru in Kerala led a lifelong struggle
against upper caste domination. He coined the slogan “one
religion, one caste, one God for mankind”, which his disciple
Sahadaran Ayyapan changed into “no religion, no caste, no
God for mankind”.
Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar led the Mahad Satyagraha in
March 1927 to challenge the regressive customs of the caste
Hindus. He stressed the necessity of removing ideas of ‘high’
and ‘low’ and inculcating self-elevation through self-help,
self-respect and self-knowledge. He led a procession of
some 2,500 ‘untouchables’ through the town of Mahad to the
Chawdar tank, a public source of water tank from which the
untouchables were not allowed to draw water. Dr Ambedkar
took water from the tank and drank it. There were huge
protests by caste Hindus. Later in December 1927, Ambedkar

Socio-Religious Reform Movements  203

and his colleagues burnt the ‘Manusmriti’ at the same place
as a gesture of getting rid of inequalities.
Dr Ambedkar established the Bahishkrit Hitakarini
Sabha in 1924 to highlight the difficulties and grievances of
the dalits before the government. Its motto was: ‘Educate,
Agitate and Organise’.
● The Constitution of free India has made equality
and non-discrimination on basis of caste imperative. The
struggle against caste discrimination could not be successful
during the British rule. The foreign government had its
limitations—it could not afford to invite hostile reaction
from the orthodox sections by taking up any radical measures.
Also, no social uplift was possible without economic and
political upliftment. All this could be realised only under the
government of a free India. The Constitution of free India
abolishes untouchability and declares the endorsement of any
disability arising out of untouchability as unlawful. It also
forbids any restriction on access to wells, tanks, bathing
ghats, hotels, cinemas, clubs, etc. In one of the Directive
Principles, the Constitution has laid down that “the State shall
strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and
protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which
justice—social, economic and political—shall inform all the
institutions of the national life”.

A General Survey of
Socio-Cultural Reform
Movements
Socio-Cultural Reform
Movements and their Leaders
Raja Rammohan Roy and Brahmo Samaj

Raja Rammohan Roy (1772-1833), often called the the father
of Indian Renaissance and the maker of Modern India, was
a man of versatile genius.
Rammohan Roy believed in the modern scientific
approach and principles of human dignity and social equality.
He put his faith in monotheism. He wrote Gift to Monotheists
(1809) and translated into Bengali the Vedas and the five
Upanishads to prove his conviction that ancient Hindu texts
support monotheism.
In 1814, he set up the Atmiya Sabha (or Society of
Friends) in Calcutta to propagate the monotheistic ideals of
the Vedanta and to campaign against idolatry, caste rigidities,
meaningless rituals and other social ills. Strongly influenced
by rationalist ideas, he declared that Vedanta is based on
reason and that, if reason demanded it, even a departure from
the scriptures is justified.
206

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  207

He said the principles of rationalism applied to other
sects also, particularly to the elements of blind faith in them.
In his Precepts of Jesus (1820), he tried to separate the
moral and philosophical message of the New Testament,
which he praised, from its miracle stories. He earned the
wrath of missionaries over his advocacy to incorporate the
message of Christ into Hinduism.
He stood for a creative and intellectual process of
selecting the best from different cultures, over which, again,
he faced orthodox reaction.
Raja Rammohan Roy founded the Brahmo Sabha in
August 1828; it was later renamed Brahmo Samaj. Through
the Sabha he wanted to institutionalise his ideas and mission.
The Samaj was committed to “the worship and adoration of
the Eternal, Unsearchable, Immutable Being who is the
Author and Preserver of the Universe”. Prayers, meditation
and readings of the Upanishads were to be the forms of
worship and no graven image, statue or sculpture, carving,
painting, picture, portrait, etc., were to be allowed in the
Samaj buildings, thus underlining the Samaj’s opposition to
idolatry and meaningless rituals. The long-term agenda of the
Brahmo Samaj—to purify Hinduism and to preach
monotheism—was based on the twin pillars of reason and
the Vedas and Upanishads. The Samaj also tried to incorporate
teachings of other religions and kept its emphasis on human
dignity, opposition to idolatry and criticism of social evils
such as sati.
Rammohan Roy did not want to establish a new religion.
He only wanted to purify Hinduism of the evil practices
which had crept into it. Roy’s progressive ideas met with
strong opposition from orthodox elements like Raja Radhakant
Deb who organised the Dharma Sabha to counter Brahmo
Samaj propaganda. Roy’s death in 1833 was a setback for
the Samaj’s mission.
View
Raja Rammohan Roy and his Brahmo Samaj form the starting
point for all the various reform movements—whether in Hindu
religion, society or politics—which have agitated modern India.
—H.C.E. Zacharias

208  

The features of Brahmo Samaj may be summed thus—
● it denounced polytheism and idol worship;
● it discarded faith in divine avataras (incarnations);
● it denied that any scripture could enjoy the status
of ultimate authority transcending human reason and
conscience;
● it took no definite stand on the doctrine of karma
and transmigration of soul and left it to individual
Brahmos to believe either way;
● it criticised the caste system.
His ideas and activities were also aimed at political
uplift of the masses through social reform and, to that extent,
can be said to have had nationalist undertones.
Raja Rammohan Roy’s Efforts at Social Reform
Rammohan was a determined crusader against the inhuman
practice of sati. He started his anti-sati struggle in 1818 and
he cited sacred texts to prove his contention that no religion
sanctioned the burning alive of widows, besides appealing to
humanity, reason and compassion. He also visited the
cremation grounds, organised vigilance groups and filed
counter petitions to the government during his struggle
against sati. His efforts were rewarded by the Government
Regulation in 1829 which declared the practice of sati a
crime.
As a campaigner for women’s rights, Roy condemned
the general subjugation of women and opposed prevailing
misconceptions which formed the basis of according an
inferior social status to women. Roy attacked polygamy and
the degraded state of widows and demanded the right of
inheritance and property for women.
Rammohan Roy did much to disseminate the benefits
of modern education to his countrymen. He supported David
Hare’s efforts to found the Hindu College in 1817, while
Roy’s English school taught mechanics and Voltaire’s
philosophy. In 1825, he established a Vedanta college where
courses in both Indian learning and Western social and
physical sciences were offered. He also helped enrich the
Bengali language by compiling a Bengali grammar book and
evolving a modern elegant prose style.

I regret to say that the present system of religion adhered to by
the Hindus is not well calculated to promote their political
interests.... it is, I think, necessary that some change should take
place in their religion at least for the sake of their political
advantage and social comfort.
—Raja Rammohan Roy

Rammohan was a gifted linguist. He knew more than
a dozen languages including Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, English,
French, Latin, Greek and Hebrew. A knowledge of different
languages helped him broadbase his range of study.
As a bold supporter of freedom of the Press and as
a pioneer in Indian journalism, Roy brought out journals in
Bengali, Hindi, English, Persian to educate and inform the
public and represent their grievances before the government.
As a political activist, Roy condemned oppressive
practices of Bengali zamindars and demanded fixation of
maximum rents. He also demanded abolition of taxes on taxfree lands. He called for a reduction of export duties on
Indian goods abroad and abolition of the East India Company’s
trading rights. He demanded the Indianisation of superior
services and separation of the executive from the judiciary.
He demanded judicial equality between Indians and Europeans
and that trial be held by jury.
Rammohan was an internationalist with a vision beyond
his times. He stood for cooperation of thought and activity
and brotherhood among nations. His understanding of the
universal character of the principles of liberty, equality and
justice indicated that he well understood the significance of
the modern age. He supported the revolutions of Naples and
Spanish America and condemned the oppression of Ireland
by absentee English landlordism and threatened emigration
from the empire if the reform bill was not passed.
Roy had David Hare, Alexander Duff, Debendranath
Tagore, P.K. Tagore, Chandrashekhar Deb and Tarachand
Chakraborty as his associates.
Debendranath Tagore and Brahmo Samaj
Maharishi Debendranath Tagore (1817-1905), father of
Rabindranath Tagore and a product of the best in traditional

210  

Indian learning and Western thought, gave a new life to
Brahmo Samaj and a definite form and shape to the theist
movement, when he joined the Samaj in 1842. Earlier, Tagore
headed the Tattvabodhini Sabha (founded in 1839) which,
along with its organ Tattvabodhini Patrika in Bengali, was
devoted to the systematic study of India’s past with a rational
outlook and to the propagation of Rammohan’s ideas. A new
vitality and strength of membership came to be associated
with the Brahmo Samaj due to the informal association of
the two sabhas. Gradually, the Brahmo Samaj came to include
prominent followers of Rammohan, the Derozians and
independent thinkers such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and
Ashwini Kumar Datta. Tagore worked on two fronts: within
Hinduism, the Brahmo Samaj was a reformist movement;
outside, it resolutely opposed the Christian missionaries for
their criticism of Hinduism and their attempts at conversion.
The revitalised Samaj supported widow remarriage, women’s
education, abolition of polygamy, improvement in ryots’
conditions and temperance.
Keshab Chandra Sen and the Brahmo Samaj
The Brahmo Samaj experienced another phase of energy,
when Keshab Chandra Sen (1838-1884) was made the
acharya by Debendranath Tagore soon after the former
joined the Samaj in 1858. Keshab (also spelt Keshub) was
instrumental in popularising the movement, and branches of
the Samaj were opened outside Bengal—in the United
Provinces, Punjab, Bombay, Madras and other towns.
Unfortunately, Debendranath did not like some of Sen’s ideas
which he found too radical, such as cosmopolitanisation of
the Samaj’s meetings by inclusion of teachings from all
religions and his strong views against the caste system, even
open support to inter-caste marriages. Keshab Chandra Sen
was dismissed from the office of acharya in 1865.
Keshab and his followers founded the Brahmo Samaj

his fellow countrymen as brethren.
—Keshab Chandra Sen

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  211

of India in 1866, while Debendranath Tagore’s Samaj came
to be known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj.
In 1878, Keshab’s inexplicable act of getting his
thirteen-year-old daughter married to the minor Hindu
Maharaja of Cooch-Behar with all the orthodox Hindu rituals
caused another split in Keshab’s Brahmo Samaj of India.
Earlier, Keshab had begun to be considered as an incarnation
by some of his followers, much to the dislike of his
progressive followers. Further, Keshab had begun to be
accused of authoritarianism.
After 1878, the disgusted followers of Keshab set up
a new organisation, the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. The
Sadharan Brahmo Samaj was started by Ananda Mohan Bose,
Shibchandra Deb and Umesh Chandra Datta. It reiterated the
Brahmo doctrines of faith in a Supreme being, one God, the
belief that no scripture or man is infallible, belief in the
dictates of reason, truth and morality.
A number of Brahmo centres were opened in Madras
province. In Punjab, the Dayal Singh Trust sought to implant
Brahmo ideas by the opening of Dayal Singh College at
Lahore in 1910.
Significance of the Brahmo Samaj
In matters of social reform, the Samaj attacked many dogmas
and superstitions. It condemned the prevailing Hindu prejudice
against going abroad. It worked for a respectable status for
women in society—condemned sati, worked for abolition of
purdah system, discouraged child marriage and polygamy,
crusaded for widow remarriage and for provisions of
educational facilities. It also attacked casteism and
untouchability though in these matters it attained only limited
success.
The influence of the Brahmo Samaj, however, did not
go much beyond Calcutta and, at most, Bengal. It did not have
a lasting impact.

Prarthana Samaj
In 1867, Keshab Chandra Sen helped Atmaram Pandurang
found the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay. Earlier, the Brahmo
ideas spread in Maharashtra. A precursor of the Prarthana

212  

Samaj was the Paramahansa Sabha, something like a secret
society to spread liberal ideas and encourage the breakdown
of caste and communal barriers. Mahadeo Govind Ranade
(1842-1901), joined the samaj in 1870, and much of the
popularity of and work done by the society was due to his
efforts. His efforts made the samaj gain an all-India character.
Other leaders of the samaj were R.G. Bhandarkar (18371925) and N.G. Chandavarkar (1855-1923). The emphasis
was on monotheism, but on the whole, the samaj was more
concerned with social reforms than with religion. The
Prarthana Sabha was very attached to the bhakti cult of
Maharashtra. The samaj relied on education and persuasion
and not on confrontation with Hindu orthodoxy. There was
a four-point social agenda also: (i) disapproval of caste
system, (ii) women’s education, (iii) widow remarriage, and
(iv) raising the age of marriage for both males and females.
Dhondo Keshav Karve and Vishnu Shastri were champions
of social reform with Ranade. Along with Karve, Ranade
founded the Widow Remarriage Movement as well as Widows’
Home Association with the aim of providing education and
training to widows so that they could support themselves.

Young Bengal Movement and
Henry Vivian Derozio
During the late 1820s and early 1830s, there emerged a
radical, intellectual trend among the youth in Bengal, which
came to be known as the ‘Young Bengal Movement’. A young
Anglo-Indian, Henry Vivian Derozio (1809-31), who taught
at the Hindu College from 1826 to 1831, was the leader and
inspirer of this progressive trend. Drawing inspiration from
the great French Revolution, Derozio inspired his pupils to
think freely and rationally, question all authority, love liberty,
equality and freedom, and oppose decadent customs and
traditions. The Derozians also supported women’s rights and
education. Also, Derozio was perhaps the first nationalist
poet of modern India.
The Derozians, however, failed to have a long-term
impact. Derozio was removed from the Hindu College in
1831 because of his radicalism. The main reason for their
limited success was the prevailing social conditions at that

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  213

time, which were not ripe for the adoption of radical ideas.
Further, there was no support from any other social group
or class. The Derozians lacked any real link with the masses;
for instance, they failed to take up the peasants’ cause. In
fact, their radicalism was bookish in character. But, despite
their limitations, the Derozians carried forward Rammohan
Roy’s tradition of public education on social, economic and
political questions. For instance, they demanded induction of
Indians in higher grades of services, protection of ryots from
oppressive zamindars, better treatment to Indian labour
abroad in British colonies, revision of the Company’s charter,
freedom of press and trial by jury.
Later, Surendranath Banerjea was to describe the
Derozians as “the pioneers of the modern civilisation of
Bengal, the conscript fathers of our race whose virtues will
excite veneration and whose failings will be treated with
gentlest consideration”.

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
The great scholar and reformer, Vidyasagar’s ideas were a
happy blend of Indian and Western thought. He believed in
high moral values, was a deep humanist and was generous
to the poor. In 1850, he became the principal of Sanskrit
College. He was determined to break the priestly monopoly
of scriptural knowledge, and for this he opened the Sanskrit
College to non-brahmins. He introduced Western thought in
Sanskrit College to break the self-imposed isolation of
Sanskritic learning. As an academician, he evolved a new
methodology to teach Sanskrit. He also devised a new Bengali
primer and evolved a new prose style.
Vidyasagar started a movement in support of widow
remarriage which resulted in legalisation of widow remarriage.
He was also a crusader against child marriage and polygamy.
He did much for the cause of women’s education. As
government inspector of schools, he helped organise thirtyfive girls’ schools many of which he ran at his own expense.
As secretary of Bethune School (established in 1849), he
was one of the pioneers of higher education for women in
India.

214  

The Bethune School, founded in Calcutta, was the result
of the powerful movement for women’s education that arose
in the 1840s and 1850s. The movement had to face great
difficulties. The young students were shouted at and abused
and, sometimes, even their parents subjected to social
boycott. Many believed that girls who had received Western
education would make slaves of their husbands.

Balshastri Jambhekar

Balshastri Jambhekar (1812-1846) was a pioneer of social
reform through journalism in Bombay; he attacked brahminical
orthodoxy and tried to reform popular Hinduism. He started
the newspaper Darpan in 1832. Known as the father of
Marathi journalism, Jambhekar used the Darpan to awaken
the people to awareness of social reforms, such as widow
remarriage, and to instil in the masses a scientific approach
to life. In 1840, he started Digdarshan which published
articles on scientific subjects as well as history.
Jambhekar founded the Bombay Native General Library
and started the Native Improvement Society of which an
offshoot was the Students Literary and Scientific Library. He
was the first professor of Hindi at the Elphinston College,
besides being a director of the Colaba Observatory.

Paramahansa Mandali

Founded in 1849 in Maharashtra, the founders of the
Paramahansa Mandali—Dadoba Pandurang, Mehtaji Durgaram
and others—began as a secret society that worked to reform
Hindu religion and society in general. The ideology of the
society was closely linked to that of the Manav Dharma
Sabha. Besides believing that one god should be worshipped,
the society also said real religion is based on love and moral
conduct. Freedom of thought was encouraged as was
rationality. The founders of the mandali were primarily
interested in breaking caste rules. At their meetings, food
cooked by lower caste people was taken by the members.
These mandalis also advocated widow remarriage and women’s
education. Branches of Paramahansa Mandali existed in
Poona, Satara and other towns of Maharashtra.

Satyashodhak Samaj and Jyotiba or
Jyotirao Phule

Jyotiba Phule (1827-1890), born in Satara, Maharashtra,
belonged to the mali (gardener) community and organised
a powerful movement against upper caste domination and
brahminical supremacy. Phule founded the Satyashodhak
Samaj (Truth Seekers’ Society) in 1873, with the leadership
of the samaj coming from the backward classes, malis, telis,
kunbis, saris and dhangars. The main aims of the movement
were (i) social service, and (ii) spread of education among
women and lower caste people.
Phule’s works, Sarvajanik Satyadharma and Gulamgiri,
became sources of inspiration for the common masses. Phule
used the symbol of Rajah Bali as opposed to the brahmins’
symbol of Rama. Phule aimed at the complete abolition of
the caste system and socio-economic inequalities; he was
against Sanskritic Hinduism. This movement gave a sense of
identity to the depressed communities as a class against those
brahmins who used religion and the blind faith of the masses
to exploit the masses for personal monetary gain.
Phule, a firm believer in gender equality, was a pioneer
in women’s education; he with the help of his wife, Savitribai,
opened a girls’ school at Poona; he was a pioneer of widow
remarriage movement in Maharashtra and also opened a home
for widows in 1854. Phule was awarded the title ‘Mahatma’
for his social reform work.

Gopalhari Deshmukh ‘Lokahitawadi’

Gopalhari Deshmukh (1823-1892) was a social reformer and
rationalist from Maharashtra. He held the post of a judge
under British raj, but wrote for a weekly Prabhakar under
the pen name of Lokahitawadi on social reform issues.
He advocated a reorganisation of Indian society on rational
principles and modern, humanistic, secular values. He attacked
Hindu orthodoxy and supported social and religious equality.
He wrote against the evils of the caste system. He said, “If
religion does not sanction social reform, then change religion.”
He started a weekly, Hitechhu, and also played a leading role
in founding the periodicals, Gyan Prakash, Indu Prakash
and Lokahitawadi.

216  

Gopal Ganesh Agarkar

Gopal Ganesh Agarkar (1856-1895) was an educationist and
social reformer from Maharashtra. A strong advocate of the
power of human reason, he criticised the blind dependence
on tradition and false glorification of the past. He was a cofounder of the New English School, the Deccan Education
Society and Fergusson College. He was a principal of
Fergusson College. He was also the first editor of Kesari,
the journal started by Lokmanya Tilak. Later, he started his
own periodical, Sudharak, which spoke against untouchability
and the caste system.

The Servants of India Society

Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1866-1915), a liberal leader of the
Indian National Congress, founded the Servants of India
Society in 1905 with the help of M.G. Ranade. The aim of
the society was to train national missionaries for the service
of India; to promote, by all constitutional means, the true
interests of the Indian people; and to prepare a cadre of
selfless workers who were to devote their lives to the cause
of the country in a religious spirit. In 1911, the Hitavada
began to be published to project the views of the society.
The society chose to remain aloof from political activities
and organisations like the Indian National Congress.
After Gokhale’s death (1915), Srinivasa Shastri took
over as president. The society still continues to function,
though with a shrunken base, at many places in India. It works
in the field of education, providing ashram type of schools
for tribal girls and balwadis at many places.

Social Service League

A follower of Gokhale, Narayan Malhar Joshi founded the
Social Service League in Bombay with an aim to secure for
the masses better and reasonable conditions of life and work.
They organised many schools, libraries, reading rooms, day
nurseries and cooperative societies. Their activities also
included police court agents’ work, legal aid and advice to
the poor and illiterate, excursions for slum dwellers, facilities
for gymnasia and theatrical performances, sanitary work,
medical relief and boys’ clubs and scout corps. Joshi also
founded the All India Trade Union Congress (1920).

The Ramakrishna Movement and
Swami Vivekananda

The didactic nationalism of the Brahmo Samaj appealed more
to the intellectual elite in Bengal, while the average Bengali
found more emotional satisfaction in the cult of bhakti and
yoga. The teachings of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (18361886), a poor priest at the Kali temple in Dakshineshwar,
on the outskirts of Calcutta (who was known in childhood
as Gadadhar Chattopadhyay) found many followers.
Ramakrishna experienced spiritual trances (ecstasy) from a
very early age. He is considered to have attained the highest
spiritual experience available to Hindus. He did not write
books, but his conversations with people formed the basis
of what were considered his teachings. He spoke simply, in
the form of parables and metaphors, drawn from the observation
of ordinary life and nature. But what he said was of universal
relevance. Two objectives of the Ramakrishna movement
were—(i) to bring into existence a band of monks dedicated
to a life of renunciation and practical spirituality, from among
whom teachers and workers would be sent out to spread the
universal message of Vedanta as illustrated in the life of
Ramakrishna, and (ii) in conjunction with lay disciples to
carry on preaching, philanthropic and charitable works, looking
upon all men, women and children, irrespective of caste,
creed or colour, as veritable manifestations of the Divine.
Paramahamsa himself laid the foundations of the Ramakrishna
Math with his young monastic disciples as a nucleus to fulfil
the first objective. The second objective was taken up by
Swami Vivekananda after Ramakrishna’s death when he founded
the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897. The headquarters of the
Ramakrishna Math and Mission are at Belur near Calcutta.
The two are twin organisations, though legally and financially
separate
Paramahamsa sought salvation through traditional ways
of renunciation, meditation and bhakti amidst increasing
westernisation and modernisation. He recognised the
fundamental oneness of all religions and emphasised that
Krishna, Hari, Ram, Christ, Allah are different names for the
same God, and that there are many ways to God and salvation:

218  

“As many faiths, so many paths.” Paramahamsa’s spirituality
and compassion for the suffering humanity inspired those
who listened to him. He used to say, “Service of man is the
service of God.”
Incidentally, Ramakrishna was married to Saradmani
Mukherjee, later known as Sarada Devi. Ramakrishna
considered Sarada as the embodiment of the Divine Mother.
It was as ‘holy mother’ that the disciples also knew her as.
She played an important role in the work of the math and
encouraging the young disciples in their mission.
Swami Vivekananda
Narendranath Datta (1862-1902), who later came to be
known as Swami Vivekananda spread Ramakrishna’s message
and tried to reconcile it to the needs of contemporary Indian
society. He emerged as the preacher of neo-Hinduism.
Certain spiritual experiences of Ramakrishna, the teachings
of the Upanishads and the Gita and the examples of the
Buddha and Jesus are the basis of Vivekananda’s message to
the world about human values. He subscribed to the Vedanta
which he considered a fully rational system with a superior
approach. His mission was to bridge the gulf between
paramartha (service) and vyavahara (behaviour), and between
spirituality and day-to-day life.
Vivekananda believed in the fundamental oneness of
God and said, “For our own motherland a junction of the two
great systems, Hinduism and Islam, is the only hope.”
Emphasising social action, he declared that knowledge
without action is useless. He lamented the isolationist
tendencies and the touch-me-not attitude of Hindus in
religious matters. He frowned at religion’s tacit approval of
the oppression of the poor by the rich. He believed that it
was an insult to God and humanity to teach religion to a
starving man. He pointed out that the masses needed two
kinds of knowledge—secular knowledge about how to work
for their economic uplift and the spiritual knowledge to have
faith in themselves and strengthen their moral sense. He
called upon his countrymen to imbibe a spirit of liberty,
equality and free thinking.

No other religion preaches the dignity of humanity in such a lofty

—Swami Vivekananda

Forget not that the lower classes, the ignorant, the poor, the
illiterate, the cobbler, the sweeper are thy flesh and blood, thy

—Swami Vivekananda

At the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in
1893, Swami Vivekananda made a great impression on people
by his learned interpretations. The keynote of his opening
address was the need for a healthy balance between spiritualism
and materialism. Envisaging a new culture for the whole
world, he called for a blend of the materialism of the West
and the spiritualism of the East into a new harmony to
produce happiness for mankind. Vivekananda gave several
lectures on Vedanta in the USA and in London before
returning to India in 1897.
In India he delivered a series of lectures, the focus of
which were to infuse into the new generation a sense of pride
in India’s past, a new faith in India’s culture, and a rare sense
of confidence in India’s future; to bring about a unification
of Hinduism by pointing out the common foundation of its
sects; to make the educated people see the misery of the
downtrodden and work for their uplift by the application of
practical Vedanta principles. His emphasis was not only on
personal salvation, but also on social good and reform.
In 1897 he founded the Ramakrishna Mission.
Vivekananda was a great humanist and used the Ramakrishna
Mission for humanitarian relief and social work. The Mission
stands for religious and social reform. Vivekananda advocated
the doctrine of service—the service of all beings. The service
of jiva (living objects) is the worship of Siva. Life itself

220  

View
So far as Bengal is concerned Vivekananda may be regarded
as the spiritual father of the modern nationalist movement.
—Subash Chandra Bose

is religion. By service, the Divine exists within man.
Vivekananda was for using technology and modern science
in the service of mankind.
Ever since its inception, the Mission has been running
a number of schools, hospitals, dispensaries. It offers help
to the afflicted in times of natural calamities like earthquakes,
famines, floods and epidemics. The Mission has developed
into a worldwide organisation. It is a deeply religious body,
but it is not a proselytising body. It does not consider itself
to be a sect of Hinduism. In fact, this is one of the strong
reasons for the success of the Mission. Unlike the Arya
Samaj, the Mission recognises the utility and value of image
worship in developing spiritual fervour and worship of the
eternal omnipotent God, although it emphasises on the
essential spirit and not the symbols or rituals. It believes that
the philosophy of Vedanta will make a Christian a better
Christian, and a Hindu a better Hindu.
It was in 1898 that Swami Vivekananda acquired a large
piece of land at Belur where the Ramakrishna Math was
finally shifted and registered as such. The monastic order is
open to all men without discrimination on the basis of caste
or creed.

Dayananda Saraswati and Arya Samaj

The Arya Samaj Movement, revivalist in form though not in
content, was the result of a reaction to Western influences.
Its founder, Dayananda Saraswati or Mulshankar (1824-1883)
was born in the old Morvi state in Gujarat in a brahmin family.
He wandered as an ascetic for fifteen years (1845-60) in
search of truth. The first Arya Samaj unit was formally set
up by him at Bombay in 1875 and later the headquarters of
the Samaj were established at Lahore.
Dayananda’s views were published in his famous work,
Satyarth Prakash (The True Exposition). His vision of India

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  221

included a classless and casteless society, a united India
(religiously, socially and nationally), and an India free from
foreign rule, with Aryan religion being the common religion
of all. He took inspiration from the Vedas and considered
them to be ‘India’s Rock of Ages’, the infallible and the true
original seed of Hinduism. He gave the slogan “Back to the
Vedas”.
Dayananda’s slogan of ‘Back to the Vedas’ was a call
for a revival of Vedic learning and Vedic purity of religion
and not a revival of Vedic times. He accepted modernity and
displayed a patriotic attitude to national problems.
Dayananda had received education on Vedanta from a
blind teacher named Swami Virajananda in Mathura. Along
with his emphasis on Vedic authority, he stressed the
significance of individual interpretation of the scriptures and
said that every person has the right of access to God. He
criticised later Hindu scriptures such as the Puranas and the
ignorant priests for perverting Hinduism.
Dayananda strongly criticised the escapist Hindu belief
in maya (illusion) as the running theme of all physical
existence and the aim of human life as a struggle to attain
moksha (salvation) through escape from this evil world to
seek union with God. Instead, he advocated that God, soul
and matter (prakriti) were distinct and eternal entities and
every individual had to work out his own salvation in the light
of the eternal principles governing human conduct. Thus he
attacked the prevalent popular belief that every individual
contributed and got back from the society according the
principles of niyati (destiny). Dayananda believed in the
theory of karma and reincarnation. But he also said the good
deeds should be primarily for the good of others and not
for self.
Dayananda launched a frontal attack on Hindu orthodoxy,
caste rigidities, untouchability, idolatry, polytheism, belief in
magic, charms and animal sacrifices, taboo on sea voyages,
feeding the dead through shraddhas, etc.
Dayananda subscribed to the Vedic notion of
chaturvarna system in which a person was identified as a
brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya or shudra not by birth but according
to the occupation and merit of the person.

222  

The Arya Samaj fixed the minimum marriageable age
at twenty-five years for boys and sixteen years for girls.
Swami Dayananda once lamented the Hindu race as “the
children of children”.
The ten guiding principles of the Arya Samaj are—
(i) God is the primary source of all true knowledge; (ii) God,
as all-truth, all-knowledge, almighty, immortal, creator of
Universe, is alone worthy of worship; (iii) the Vedas are the
books of true knowledge; (iv) an Arya should always be ready
to accept truth and abandon untruth; (v) dharma, that is, due
consideration of right and wrong, should be the guiding
principle of all actions; (vi) the principal aim of the Samaj
is to promote world’s well-being in the material, spiritual
and social sense; (vii) everybody should be treated with love
and justice; (viii) ignorance is to be dispelled and knowledge
increased; (ix) one’s own progress should depend on uplift
of all others; (x) social well-being of mankind is to be placed
above an individual’s well-being.
The Arya Samaj’s social ideals comprise, among others,
the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of Man, equality of
the sexes, absolute justice and fair play between man and man
and nation and nation. Intercaste marriages and widow
remarriages were also encouraged.
Dayananda also met other reformers of the time—
Keshab Chandra Sen, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Ranade,
Deshmukh, etc.
The Arya Samaj came to be known for the social service
it rendered in times of calamities such as earthquake, famine
and floods. It also took initiative in promoting education.
After the death of Dayananda in 1883, the work of the
samaj was carried on by illustrious members. Education was
an all-important field for the samaj. The Dayananda AngloVedic (D.A.V.) College was established in 1886 at Lahore.
But a difference of opinion between two groups in the samaj
arose over the curriculum of the D.A.V. College. One group
was known as the College Party (some sources say ‘Culture’
Party), among whose leaders were Lala Hansraj, Lala Lal
Chand and Lala Lajpat Rai, and the other was the Mahatma
(later Gurukul) Party led by Guru Datta Vidyarthi and Lala
Munshi Ram (who later came to be known as Swami

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  223

Shraddhanand). While the College Party favoured the
government curriculum and English education to meet
economic and professional needs, the Mahatma Party was
interested in introducing the study of Sanskrit and Vedic
philosophy in the tradition of ancient gurukuls. Later, the
issue of vegetarianism also became a point of contention:
the College Party had nothing against non-vegetarianism,
claiming that diet was a personal choice and it was not
mentioned in the principles of the samaj; the Mahatma Party
was in favour of all the Aryas being strict vegetarians. In the
end the Arya Samaj split in 1893 over these issues.
The College Party retained control over the D.A.V.
School and College, while the Arya Partinidhi Sabha, Punjab
and a majority of the local Arya Samaj branches were taken
over by the Mahatma Party. Swami Shraddhanand opened the
Gurukul in 1900 at Gujaranwala (in West Punjab, now in
Pakistan). In 1902, the Gurukul was moved to Kangri near
Haridwar, hence the name, Gurukul Kangri. The gurukul
aimed at providing an indigenous alternative to Lord
Macaulay’s education policy by offering education in the
areas of vedic literature, Indian philosophy, Indian culture as
well as modern sciences and research. The Gurukul believed
in radical social reform. It founded the Kanya Mahavidyalaya
at Jalandhar in 1896, and sponsored education for widows.
The Arya Samaj was able to give self-respect and selfconfidence to the Hindus which helped to undermine the
myth of superiority of whites and the Western culture.
In its zeal to protect the Hindu society from the
onslaught of Christianity and Islam, the Samaj started the
shuddhi (purification) movement to reconvert to the Hindu
fold the converts to Christianity and Islam. An aggressive
campaign of shuddhi led to increasing communalisation of
social life during the 1920s and later snowballed into
communal political consciousness. The shuddhi movement
also attempted to uplift those regarded as untouchables and
outside the caste system of Hindus into pure caste Hindus.

Seva Sadan
A Parsi social reformer, Behramji M. Malabari (18531912), founded the Seva Sadan in 1908 along with a friend,

224  

Diwan Dayaram Gidumal. Malabari spoke vigorously against
child marriage and for widow remarriage among Hindus. It
was his efforts that led to the Age of Consent Act regulating
the age of consent for females, Seva Sadan specialised in
taking care of those women who were exploited and then
discarded by society. It catered to all castes and provided
the destitute women with education, and medical and welfare
services.
[Behramji Malabari acquired and edited the Indian
Spectator.]

Dev Samaj

Founded in 1887 at Lahore by Shiv Narayan Agnihotri (18501927), earlier a Brahmo follower, Dev Sadan is a religious
and social reform society. The society emphasised on the
eternity of the soul, the supremacy of the guru, and the need
for good action. It called for an ideal social behaviour such
as not accepting bribes, avoiding intoxicants and non-vegetarian
food, and keeping away from violent actions. Its teachings
were compiled in a book, Deva Shastra. Agnihotri spoke
against child marriage.

Dharma Sabha

Radhakant Deb founded this sabha in 1830. An orthodox
society, it stood for the preservation of the status quo in
socio-religious matters, opposing even the abolition of sati.
However, it favoured the promotion of Western education,
even for girls.

Bharat Dharma Mahamandala

An all-India organisation of the orthodox educated Hindus,
it stood for a defence of orthodox Hinduism against the
teachings of the Arya Samajists, the Theosophists, and the
Ramakrishna Mission. Other organisations created to defend
orthodox Hinduism were the Sanatana Dharma Sabha (1895),
the Dharma Maha Parishad in South India, and Dharma
Mahamandali in Bengal. These organisations combined in
1902 to form the single organisation of Bharat Dharma
Mahamandala, with headquarters at Varanasi. This organisation
sought to introduce proper management of Hindu religious
institutions, open Hindu educational institutions, etc. Pandit

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  225

Madan Mohan Malaviya was a prominent figure in this
movement.

Radhaswami Movement

Tulsi Ram, a banker from Agra, also known as Shiv Dayal
Saheb, founded this movement in 1861. The Radhaswamis
believe in one supreme being, supremacy of the guru, a
company of pious people (satsang), and a simple social life.
Spiritual attainment, they believe, does not call for renunciation
of the worldly life. They consider all religions to be true.
While the sect has no belief in temples, shrines and sacred
places, it considers as necessary duties, works of faith and
charity, service and prayer.

Sree Narayana Guru Dharma Paripalana
(SNDP) Movement

The SNDP movement was an example of a regional movement
born out of conflict between the depressed classes and upper
castes. It was started by Sree Narayana Guru Swamy (18561928) among the Ezhavas of Kerala, who were a backward
caste of toddy-tappers and were considered to be untouchables,
denied education and entry into temples. The Ezhavas were
the single largest caste group in Kerala constituting 26 per
cent of the total population. Narayana Guru, himself from
the Ezhava caste, took a stone from the Neyyar river and
installed it as a Sivalinga at Aruvippuram on Sivaratri in 1888.
It was intended to show that consecration of an idol was not
the monopoly of the higher castes. With this he began a
revolution that soon led to the removal of many
discriminations in Kerala’s society. The movement
(Aruvippuram movement) drew the famous poet Kumaran
Asan as a disciple of Narayana Guru. In 1889, the Aruvippuram
Kshetra Yogam was formed which was decided to expand into
a big organisation to help the Ezhavas to progress materially
as well as spiritually.
Thus the Aruvippuram Sree Narayana Guru Dharma
Paripalana Yogam (in short SNDP) was registered in 1903
under the Indian Companies Act, with Narayana Guru as its
permanent chairman, and Kumaran Asan as the general
secretary. (In the formation of SNDP, the efforts of Dr Palpu

226  

must be acknowledged. He had started the fight for social
justice through movements like Ezhava Memorial, Malayali
Memorial, etc.)
Sree Narayana Guru held all religions to be the same
and condemned animal sacrifice besides speaking against
divisiveness on the basis of caste, race or creed. On the wall
of the Aruvippuram temple he got inscribed the words,
“Devoid of dividing walls of caste or race, or hatred of rival
faith, we all live here in brotherhood.” He urged the Ezhavas
to leave the toddy tapping profession and even to stop
drinking liquor.
The SNDP Yogam took up several issues for the
Ezhavas, such as (i) right of admission to public schools, (ii)
recruitment to government services, (iii) access to roads and
entry to temples, and (iv) political representation. The
movement as a whole brought transformative structural
changes such as upward social mobility, shift in traditional
distribution of power and a federation of ‘backward castes’
into a large conglomeration.

Vokkaliga Sangha

The Vokkaliga Sangha in Mysore launched an anti-brahmin
movement in 1905.

Justice Movement

This movement in Madras Presidency was started by C.N.
Mudaliar, T.M. Nair and P. Tyagaraja to secure jobs and
representation for the non-brahmins in the legislature. In
1917, Madras Presidency Association was formed which
demanded separate representation for the lower castes in the
legislature.

Self-Respect Movement

This movement was started by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, a
Balija Naidu, in the mid-1920s. The movement aimed at
nothing short of a rejection of the brahminical religion and
culture which Naicker felt was the prime instrument of
exploitation of the lower castes. He sought to undermine the
position of brahmin priests by formalising weddings without
brahmin priests.

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  227

Temple Entry Movement

Significant work in this direction had already been done by
reformers and intellectuals like Sree Narayana Guru and
N. Kumaran Asan. T.K. Madhavan, a prominent social reformer
and editor of Deshabhimani, took up the issue of temple
entry with the Travancore administration. Nothing transpired.
In the meanwhile, Vaikom, in the northern part of Travancore,
became a centre of agitation for temple entry. In 1924, the
Vaikom Satyagraha led by K.P. Kesava, was launched in
Kerala demanding the throwing open of Hindu temples and
roads to the untouchables. The satyagraha was reinforced by
jathas from Punjab and Madurai. Gandhi undertook a tour
of Kerala in support of the movement.
Again in 1931 when the Civil Disobedience Movement
was suspended, temple entry movement was organised in
Kerala. Inspired by K. Kelappan, poet Subramaniyam
Tirumambu (the ‘singing sword of Kerala’) led a group of
sixteen volunteers to Guruvayur. Leaders like P. Krishna
Pillai and A.K. Gopalan were among the satyagrahis. Finally,
on November 12, 1936, the Maharaja of Travancore issued
a proclamation throwing open all government-controlled
temples to all Hindus.
A similar step was taken by the C. Rajagopalachari
administration in Madras in 1938.

Indian Social Conference

Founded by M.G. Ranade and Raghunath Rao, the Indian
Social Conference met annually from its first session in
Madras in 1887 at the same time and venue as the Indian
National Congress. It focussed attention on the social issues
of importance; it could be called the social reform cell of
the Indian National Congress, in fact. The conference advocated
inter-caste marriages, opposed polygamy and kulinism. It
launched the ‘Pledge Movement’ to inspire people to take
a pledge against child marriage.

Wahabi/Walliullah Movement

The teachings of Abdul Wahab of Arabia and the preachings
of Shah Walliullah (1702-1763) inspired this essentially
revivalist response to Western influences and the degeneration

228  

which had set in among Indian Muslims and called for a return
to the true spirit of Islam. He was the first Indian Muslim
leader of the 18th century to organise Muslims around the
two-fold ideals of this movement: (i) desirability of harmony
among the four schools of Muslim jurisprudence which had
divided the Indian Muslims (he sought to integrate the best
elements of the four schools); (ii) recognition of the role
of individual conscience in religion where conflicting
interpretations were derived from the Quran and the Hadis.
The teachings of Walliullah were further popularised
by Shah Abdul Aziz and Syed Ahmed Barelvi who also gave
them a political perspective. Un-Islamic practices that had
crept into Muslim society were sought to be eliminated. Syed
Ahmed called for a return to the pure Islam and the kind
of society that had existed in the Arabia of the Prophet’s
time. India was considered to be dar-ul-Harb (land of the
kafirs) and it needed to be converted to dar-ul-Islam (land
of Islam). Initially, the movement was directed at the Sikhs
in Punjab but after the British annexation of Punjab (1849),
the movement was directed against the British. During the
1857 Revolt, the Wahabi’s played an important role in
spreading anti-British feelings. The Wahabi Movement fizzled
out in the face of British military might in the 1870s.

Titu Mir‘s Movement

Mir Nithar Ali, popularly known as Titu Mir, was a disciple
of Sayyid Ahmed Barelvi, the founder of the Wahabi
Movement. Titu Mir adopted Wahabism and advocated the
Sharia. He organised the Muslim peasants of Bengal against
the landlords, who were mosly Hindu, and the British indigo
planters.The movement was not as militant as the British
records made it out to be; only in the last year of Titu’s
life was there a confrontation between him and the British
police. He was killed in action in 1831.

Faraizi Movement

The movement, also called the Fara’idi Movement because
of its emphasis on the Islamic pillars of faith, was founded
by Haji Shariatullah in 1818. Its scene of action was East
Bengal, and it aimed at the eradication of social innovations

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  229

or un-Islamic practices current among the Muslims of the
region and draw their attention to their duties as Muslims.
Under the leadership of Haji’s son, Dudu Mian, the movement
became revolutionary from 1840 onwards. He gave the
movement an organisational system from the village to the
provincial level with a khalifa or authorised deputy at every
level. The Fara’idis organised a paramilitary force armed with
clubs to fight the zamindars who were mostly Hindu, though
there were some Muslim landlords too, besides the indigo
planters. Dudu Mian asked his followers not to pay rent. The
organisation even established its own Law courts.
Dudu Mian was arrested several times, and his arrest
in 1847 finally weakened the movement. The movement
survived merely as a religious movement without political
overtones after the death of Dudu Mian in 1862.

Ahmadiyya Movement

The Ahmadiyya forms a sect of Islam which originated from
India. It was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1889. It
was based on liberal principles. It described itself as the
standard-bearer of Mohammedan Renaissance, and based
itself, like the Brahmo Samaj, on the principles of universal
religion of all humanity, opposing jihad (sacred war against
non-Muslims). The movement spread Western liberal education
among the Indian Muslims. The Ahmadiyya community is the
only Islamic sect to believe that the Messiah had come in
the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to end religious wars
and bloodshed and to reinstate morality, peace and justice.
They believed in separating the mosque from the State as
well as in human rights and tolerance. However, the Ahmadiyya
Movement, like Baha’ism which flourished in the West Asian
countries, suffered from mysticism.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and the Aligarh
Movement

The British view on the revolt of 1857 held the Muslims
to be the main conspirators. This view was further strengthened
by the activities of the Wahabis. But later, an opinion got
currency among the rulers that the Muslims could be used
as allies against a rising tide of nationalist political activity

230  

represented, among others, by the foundation of the Indian
National Congress. This was to be achieved through offers
of thoughtful concessions to the Muslims. A section of
Muslims led by Syed Ahmed Khan (1817-1898) was ready
to allow the official patronage to stimulate a process of
growth among Indian Muslims through better education and
employment opportunities.
Syed Ahmed Khan, born in a respectable Muslim
family, was a loyalist member of the judicial service of the
British government. After retirement in 1876, he became a
member of the Imperial Legislative Council in 1878. His
loyalty earned him a knighthood in 1888. He wanted to
reconcile Western scientific education with the teachings of
the Quran which were to be interpreted in the light of
contemporary rationalism and science even though he also
held the Quran to be the ultimate authority. He said that
religion should be adaptable with time or else it would
become fossilised, and that religious tenets were not
immutable. He advocated a critical approach and freedom of
thought and not complete dependence on tradition or custom.
He was also a zealous educationist—as an official, he opened
schools in towns, got books translated into Urdu and started
the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College (later, the Aligarh
Muslim University) at Aligarh in 1875. He also struggled to
bring about an improvement in the position of women through
better education and by opposing purdah and polygamy,
advocating easy divorce, and condemning the system of piri
and muridi. He believed in the fundamental underlying unity
of religions or ‘practical morality’. He also preached the
basic commonality of Hindu and Muslim interests.
Syed Ahmed Khan argued that Muslims should first
concentrate on education and jobs and try to catch up with
their Hindu counterparts who had gained the advantage of an
early start. Active participation in politics at that point, he
felt, would invite hostility of the government towards the
Muslim masses. Therefore, he opposed political activity by
the Muslims. Unfortunately, in his enthusiasm to promote
the educational and employment interests of the Muslims,
he allowed himself to be used by the colonial government

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  231

in its obnoxious policy of divide and rule and, in later years,
started propagating divergence of interests of Hindus and
Muslims.
Syed’s progressive social ideas were propagated through
his magazine Tahdhib-ul-Akhlaq (Improvement of Manners
and Morals).
The Aligarh Movement emerged as a liberal, modern
trend among the Muslim intelligentsia based in Mohammedan
Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh. It aimed at spreading (i)
modern education among Indian Muslims without weakening
their allegiance to Islam; (ii) social reforms among Muslims
relating to purdah, polygamy, widow remarriage, women’s
education, slavery, divorce, etc. The ideology of the followers
of the movement was based on a liberal interpretation of the
Quran and they sought to harmonise Islam with modern
liberal culture. They wanted to impart a distinct socio-cultural
identity to Muslims on modern lines. Soon, Aligarh became
the centre of religious and cultural revival of the Muslim
community.

The Deoband School (Darul Uloom)

The Deoband Movement was organised by the orthodox
section among the Muslim ulema as a revivalist movement
with the twin objectives of propagating pure teachings of the
Quran and Hadis among Muslims and keeping alive the spirit
of jihad against the foreign rulers.
The Deoband Movement was begun at the Darul Uloom
(or Islamic academic centre), Deoband, in Saharanpur district
(United Provinces) in 1866 by Mohammad Qasim Nanotavi
(1832-80) and Rashid Ahmed Gangohi (1828-1905) to train
religious leaders for the Muslim community. In contrast to
the Aligarh Movement, which aimed at the welfare of
Muslims through Western education and support of the
British government, the aim of the Deoband Movement was
moral and religious regeneration of the Muslim community.
The instruction imparted at Deoband was in original Islamic
religion.
On the political front, the Deoband school welcomed
the formation of the Indian National Congress and in 1888
issued a fatwa (religious decree) against Syed Ahmed Khan’s

232  

organisations, the United Patriotic Association and the
Mohammaden Anglo-Oriental Association. Some critics
attribute Deoband’s support to the nationalists more to its
determined opposition to Syed Ahmed Khan than to any
positive political philosophy.
Mahmud-ul-Hasan, the new Deoband leader, gave a
political and intellectual content to the religious ideas of the
school. He worked out a synthesis of Islamic principles and
nationalist aspirations. The Jamiat-ul-Ulema gave a concrete
shape to Hasan’s ideas of protection of the religious and
political rights of the Muslims in the overall context of Indian
unity and national objectives.
Shibli Numani, a supporter of the Deoband school,
favoured the inclusion of English language and European
sciences in the system of education. He founded the Nadwatal
Ulama and Darul Uloom in Lucknow in 1894-96. He believed
in the idealism of the Congress and cooperation between the
Muslims and the Hindus of India to create a state in which
both could live amicably.

Parsi Reform Movements

The Rahnumai Mazdayasnan Sabha (Religious Reform
Association) was founded in 1851 by a group of Englisheducated Parsis for the “regeneration of the social conditions
of the Parsis and the restoration of the Zoroastrian religion
to its pristine purity”. The movement had Naoroji Furdonji,
Dadabhai Naoroji, K.R. Cama and S.S. Bengalee as its leaders.
The message of reform was spread by the newspaper Rast
Goftar (Truth-Teller). Parsi religious rituals and practices
were reformed and the Parsi creed redefined. In the social
sphere, attempts were made to uplift the status of Parsi
women through removal of the purdah system, raising the
age of marriage and education. Gradually, the Parsis emerged
as the most westernised section of the Indian society.

Sikh Reform Movements

The Sikh community could not remain untouched by the
rising tide of rationalist and progressive ideas of the nineteenth
century.
The Singh Sabha Movement was founded at Amritsar
in 1873 with a two-fold objective—(i) to make available

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  233

modern western education to the Sikhs, and (ii) to counter
the proselytising activities of Christian missionaries as well
as the Brahmo Samajists, Arya Samajists and Muslim maulvis.
For the first objective, a network of Khalsa schools was
established by the Sabha throughout Punjab. In the second
direction, everything that went against the Gurus’ teachings
was rejected, and rites and customs considered to be
consistent with Sikh doctrine were sought to be established.
The Akali movement (also known as Gurudwara Reform
Movement) was an offshoot of the Singh Sabha Movement.
It aimed at liberating the Sikh gurudwaras from the control
of corrupt Udasi mahants (the post having become hereditary).
These mahants were a loyalist and reactionary lot, enjoying
government patronage. The government tried its repressive
policies against the non-violent non-cooperation satyagraha
launched by the Akalis in 1921, but had to bow before popular
demands; it passed the Sikh Gurudwaras Act in 1922 (amended
in 1925) which gave the control of gurudwaras to the Sikh
masses to be administered through Shiromani Gurudwara
Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) as the apex body.
The Akali Movement was a regional movement but not
a communal one. The Akali leaders played a notable role in
the national liberation struggle though some dissenting voices
were heard occasionally.

The Theosophical Movement

A group of westerners led by Madame H.P. Blavatsky (18311891) and Colonel M.S. Olcott, who were inspired by Indian
thought and culture, founded the Theosophical Society in
New York City, United States in 1875. In 1882, they shifted
their headquarters to Adyar, on the outskirts of Madras (at
that time) in India. The society believed that a special
relationship could be established between a person’s soul and
God by contemplation, prayer, revelation, etc. It accepted the
Hindu beliefs in reincarnation and karma, and drew inspiration
from the philosophy of the Upanishads and samkhya, yoga
and Vedanta schools of thought. It aimed to work for
universal brotherhood of humanity without distinction of
race, creed, sex, caste or colour. The society also sought
to investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers

234  

latent in man. The Theosophical Movement came to be allied
with the Hindu renaissance. (At one time it allied with the
Arya Samaj too.) It opposed child marriage and advocated
the abolition of caste discrimination, uplift of outcastes,
improvement in the condition of widows.
In India, the movement became somewhat popular with
the election of Annie Besant (1847-1933) as its president
after the death of Olcott in 1907. Annie Besant had come
to India in 1893. She laid the foundation of the Central Hindu
College in Benaras in 1898 where both Hindu religion and
Western scientific subjects were taught. The college became
the nucleus for the formation of Benaras Hindu University
in 1916. Annie Besant also did much for the cause of the
education of women.
The Theosophical Society provided a common denominator for the various sects and fulfilled the urge of educated
Hindus. However, to an average Indian the Theosophist
philosophy seemed to be vague and lacking a positive
programme; to that extent its impact was limited to a small
segment of the westernised class. As religious revivalists, the
Theosophists did not attain much success, but as a movement
of westerners glorifying Indian religious and philosophical
traditions, it gave much needed self-respect to the Indians
fighting British colonial rule. Viewed from another angle, the
Theosophists also had the effect of giving a false sense of
pride to the Indians in their outdated and sometimes backwardlooking traditions and philosophy.

Significance of Reform
Movements
Positive Aspects

The orthodox sections of society could not accept the
scientific ideological onslaught of the socio-religious rebels.
As a result of this, the reformers were subjected to abuse,
persecution, issuing of fatwas and even assassination attempts
by the reactionaries.
However, in spite of opposition, these movements
managed to contribute towards the liberation of the individual

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  235

from the conformity born out of fear and from uncritical
submission to exploitation by the priests and other classes.
The translation of religious texts into vernacular languages,
emphasis on an individual’s right to interpret the scriptures
and simplification of rituals made worship a more personal
experience.
The movements emphasised the human intellect’s
capacity to think and reason.
By weeding out corrupt elements, religious beliefs and
practices, the reformers enabled their followers to meet the
official taunt that their religions and society were decadent
and inferior.
The reform movements gave the rising middle classes
the much needed cultural roots to cling to, and served the
purpose of reducing the sense of humiliation which the
conquest by a foreign power had produced.
A realisation of the special needs of modern times,
especially in terms of scientific knowledge, and thus promoting
a modern, this-worldly, secular and rational outlook was a
major contribution of these reform movements. Socially, this
attitude reflected in a basic change in the notions of
‘pollution and purity’. Although traditional values and customs
were a prominent target of attack from the reformers, yet
the reformers aimed at modernisation rather than outright
westernisation based on blind imitation of alien Western
cultural values. In fact, the reform movements sought to
create a favourable social climate for modernisation. To that
extent, these movements ended India’s cultural and intellectual
isolation from the rest of the world. The reformers argued
that modern ideas and culture could be best imbibed by
integrating them into Indian cultural streams.
The underlying concern of these reformist efforts was
revival of the native cultural personality which had got
distorted by various factors over the years. This cultural
ideological struggle was to prove to be an important instrument
in the evolution of national consciousness and a part of Indian
national resolve to resist colonial cultural and ideological
hegemony. However, not all these progressive, nationalist
tendencies were able to outgrow the sectarian and obscurantist

236  

outlook. This was possibly due to the divergent duality of
cultural and political struggles, resulting in cultural
backwardness despite political advancement.

Negative Aspects

One of the major limitations of the religious reform
movements was that they had a narrow social base, namely
the educated and urban middle classes, while the needs of
the vast masses of peasantry and the urban poor were ignored.
The tendency of reformers to appeal to the greatness
of the past and to rely on scriptural authority encouraged
mysticism in new garbs and fostered pseudo-scientific thinking
while exercising a check on the full acceptance of the need
for a modern scientific outlook. But, above all, these
tendencies contributed, at least to some extent, in
compartmentalising Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Parsis, as
also alienating high caste Hindus from low caste Hindus.
The emphasis on religious and philosophical aspects of
the cultural heritage got somewhat magnified by an insufficient
emphasis on other aspects of culture—art, architecture,
literature, music, science and technology. To make matters
worse, the Hindu reformers confined their praise of the
Indian past to its ancient period and looked upon the medieval
period of Indian history essentially as an era of decadence.
This tended to create a notion of two separate peoples, on
the one hand; on the other, an uncritical praise of the past
was not acceptable to the low caste sections of society which
had suffered under religiously sanctioned exploitation during
the ancient period. Moreover, the past itself tended to be
placed into compartments on a partisan basis. Many in the
Muslim middle classes went to the extent of turning to the
history of West Asia for their traditions and moments of
pride.
The process of evolution of a composite culture which
was evident throughout Indian history showed signs of being
arrested with the rise of another form of consciousness—
communal consciousness—along with national consciousness
among the middle classes.
Many other factors were certainly responsible for the

Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements  237

birth of communalism in modern times, but undoubtedly the
nature of religious reform movements also contributed to it.
On the whole, however, whatever the net outcome of
these reform movements, it was out of this struggle that a
new society evolved in India.

Beginning of Modern
Nationalism in India
Factors in the Growth of
Modern Nationalism
The rise and growth of Indian nationalism has been traditionally
explained in terms of Indian response to the stimulus
generated by the British Raj through creation of new
institutions, new opportunities, resources, etc. In other
words, Indian nationalism grew partly as a result of colonial
policies and partly as a reaction to colonial policies. In fact,
it would be more correct to see Indian nationalism as a
product of a mix of various factors:
(i) Worldwide upsurge of the concepts of nationalism
and right of self-determination initiated by the
French Revolution.
(ii) Indian Renaissance.
239

240  

(iii) Offshoot of modernisation initiated by the British in
India.
(iv) Strong reaction to British imperialist policies in
India.

Understanding of Contradictions in Indian
and Colonial Interests

People came to realise that colonial rule was the major cause
of India’s economic backwardness and that the interests of
the Indians involved the interests of all sections and classes—
peasants, artisans, handicraftsmen, workers, intellectuals, the
educated and the capitalists. The nationalist movement arose
to take up the challenge of these contradictions inherent in
the character and policies of colonial rule.

Political, Administrative and Economic
Unification of the Country

The British rule in the Indian subcontinent extended from the
Himalayas in the north to the Cape Comorin in the south
and from Assam in the east to Khyber Pass in the west. While
large areas of India had been brought under a single rule in
the past—under the Mauryas or later under the Mughals—
the British created a larger state than that of the Mauryas
or the great Mughals. While Indian provinces were under
‘direct’ British rule, the princely states were under ‘indirect’
British rule. The British sword imposed political unity in
India. A professional civil service, a unified judiciary and
codified civil and criminal laws throughout the length and
breadth of the country imparted a new dimension of political
unity to the hitherto cultural unity that had existed in India
for centuries. The necessities of administrative convenience,
considerations of military defence and the urge for economic
penetration and commercial exploitation (all in British
interests) were the driving forces behind the planned
development of modern means of transport and communication
such as railways, roads, electricity and telegraph.
From the nationalists’ point of view, this process of
unification had a two-fold effect:
(i) The economic fate of the people of different regions
got linked together; for instance, failure of crops in one
region affected the prices and supply in another region.

Beginning of Modern Nationalism in India  241

(ii) Modern means of transport and communication
brought people, especially the leaders, from different regions
together. This was important for the exchange of political
ideas and for mobilisation and organisation of public opinion
on political and economic issues.

Western Thought and Education

The introduction of a modern system of education afforded
opportunities for assimilation of modern Western ideas. This,
in turn, gave a new direction to Indian political thinking,
although the English system of education had been conceived
by the rulers in the self-interest of efficient administration.
The liberal and radical thought of European writers like
Milton, Shelley, John Stuart Mill, Rousseau, Paine, Spencer
and Voltaire helped many Indians imbibe modern rational,
secular, democratic and nationalist ideas.
The English language helped nationalist leaders from
different linguistic regions to communicate with each other.
Those among the educated who took up liberal professions
(lawyers, doctors, etc.) often visited England for higher
education. There they saw the working of modern political
institutions in a free country and compared that system with
the Indian situation where even basic rights were denied to
the citizens. This ever-expanding English educated class
formed the middle class intelligentsia who constituted the
nucleus for the newly arising political unrest. It was this
section which provided leadership to the Indian political
associations.

Role of Press and Literature

The second half of the nineteenth century saw an unprecedented
growth of Indian-owned English and vernacular newspapers,
despite numerous restrictions imposed on the press by the
colonial rulers from time to time. In 1877, there were about
169 newspapers published in vernacular languages and their
circulation reached the neighbourhood of 1,00,000.
The press while criticising official policies, on the one
hand, urged the people to unite, on the other. It also helped
spread modern ideas of self-government, democracy, civil
rights and industrialisation. The newspapers, journals,
pamphlets and nationalist literature helped in the exchange

242  

of political ideas among nationalist leaders from different
regions.

Rediscovery of India’s Past

The historical researches by European scholars, such as Max
Mueller, Monier Williams, Roth and Sassoon, and by Indian
scholars such as R.G. Bhandarkar, R.L. Mitra and later Swami
Vivekananda, created an entirely new picture of India’s past.
This picture was characterised by well-developed political,
economic and social institutions, a flourishing trade with the
outside world, a rich heritage in arts and culture and
numerous cities. The theory put forward by European scholars,
that the Indo-Aryans belonged to the same ethnic group from
which other nations of Europe had evolved, gave a
psychological boost to the educated Indians. The self-respect
and confidence so gained helped the nationalists to demolish
colonial myths that India had a long history of servility to
foreign rulers.

Progressive Character of Socio-religious
Reform Movements

These reform movements sought to remove social evils
which divided the Indian society; this had the effect of
bringing different sections together, and proved to be an
important factor in the growth of Indian nationalism.

Rise of Middle Class Intelligentsia

British administrative and economic innovations gave rise to
a new urban middle class in towns. According to Percival
Spear, “The new middle class was a well-integrated all-India
class with varied background but a common foreground of
knowledge, ideas and values.... It was a minority of Indian
society, but a dynamic minority.... It had a sense of unity
of purpose and of hope.”
This class, prominent because of its education, new
position and its close ties with the ruling class, came to the
forefront. The leadership to the Indian National Congress in
all its stages of growth was provided by this class.

Impact of Contemporary Movements
in the World

Rise of a number of nations on the ruins of the Spanish and
Portuguese empires in South America, and the national

Beginning of Modern Nationalism in India  243

liberation movements of Greece and Italy in general and of
Ireland in particular deeply influenced the nationalist ranks.

Reactionary Policies and Racial
Arrogance of Rulers

Racial myths of white superiority were sought to be perpetuated
by the British through a deliberate policy of discrimination
and segregation. Indians felt deeply hurt by this. Lytton’s
reactionary policies such as reduction of maximum age limit
for the I.C.S. examination from 21 years to 19 years (1876),
the grand Delhi Durbar of 1877 when the country was in the
severe grip of famine, the Vernacular Press Act (1878) and
the Arms Act (1878) provoked a storm of opposition in the
country. Then came the Ilbert Bill controversy. Ripon’s
Government had sought to abolish “judicial disqualification
based on race distinctions” and to give the Indian members
of the covenanted civil service the same powers and rights
as those enjoyed by their European colleagues. Ripon had
to modify the bill, thus almost defeating the original purpose,
because of the stiff opposition from the European community.
It became clear to the nationalists that justice and fair
play could not be expected where interests of the European
community were involved. However, the organised agitation
by the Europeans to revoke the Ilbert Bill also taught the
nationalists how to agitate for certain rights and demands.

Political Associations Before the
Indian National Congress
The Indian National Congress was not the first political
organisation in India. However, most of the political
associations in the early half of the nineteenth century were
dominated by wealthy and aristocratic elements. They were
local or regional in character. Through long petitions to the
British Parliament most of them demanded—
● administrative reforms,
● association of Indians with the administration, and
● spread of education.
The political associations of the second half of the
nineteenth century came to be increasingly dominated by the

244  

educated middle class—the lawyers, journalists, doctors,
teachers, etc.,—and they had a wider perspective and a larger
agenda.

Political Associations in Bengal

The Bangabhasha Prakasika Sabha was formed in
1836 by associates of Raja Rammohan Roy.
The Zamindari Association, more popularly known as
the ‘Landholders’ Society’, was founded to safeguard the
interests of the landlords. Although limited in its objectives,
the Landholders’ Society marked the beginning of an organised
political activity and use of methods of constitutional agitation
for the redressal of grievances.
The Bengal British India Society was founded in
1843 with the object of “the collection and dissemination
of information relating to the actual condition of the people
of British India... and to employ such other means of peaceful
and lawful character as may appear calculated to secure the
welfare, extend the just rights and advance the interests of
all classes of our fellow subjects”.
In 1851, both the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal
British India Society merged into the British Indian
Association. It sent a petition to the British Parliament
demanding inclusion of some of its suggestions in the
renewed Charter of the Company, such as
(i) establishment of a separate legislature of a popular
character;
(ii) separation of executive from judicial functions;
(iii) reduction in salaries of higher officers; and
(iv) abolition of salt duty, abkari and stamp duties.
These were partially accepted when the Charter Act of
1853 provided for the addition of six members to the
governor-general’s council for legislative purposes.
The East India Association was organised by Dadabhai
Naoroji in 1866 in London to discuss the Indian question
and influence public men in England to promote Indian
welfare. Later, branches of the association were started in
prominent Indian cities.
The Indian League was started in 1875 by Sisir Kumar
Ghosh with the object of “stimulating the sense of nationalism
amongst the people” and of encouraging political education.

Beginning of Modern Nationalism in India  245

The Indian Association of Calcutta (also known as
the Indian National Association) superseded the Indian
League and was founded in 1876 by younger nationalists of
Bengal led by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan
Bose, who were getting discontented with the conservative
and pro-landlord policies of the British Indian Association.
The Indian Association was the most important of preCongress associations and aimed to “promote by every
legitimate means the political, intellectual and material
advancement of the people.” It set out to—
(i) create a strong public opinion on political questions,
and
(ii) unify Indian people in a common political
programme.
It protested against the reduction of age limit in 1877
for candidates of the Indian Civil Service examination. The
association demanded simultaneous holding of civil service
examination in England and India and Indianisation of higher
administrative posts. It led a campaign against the repressive
arms act and the vernacular press act.
Branches of the association were opened in other towns
and cities of Bengal and even outside Bengal. The membership
fee was kept low in order to attract the poorer sections to
the association.
The association sponsored an all India conference
which first took place in Calcutta on December 28 to 30,
1883. More than hundred delegates from different parts of
the country attended. So, in a way the association was a
forerunner of the Indian National Congress as an all-India
nationalist organisation. It later merged with the Indian
National Congress in 1886.

Political Associations in Bombay

The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded in 1867 by
Mahadeo Govind Ranade and others, with the object of
serving as a bridge between the government and the people.
The Bombay Presidency Association was started by
Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozshah Mehta and K.T. Telang in 1885.

Political Associations in Madras

The Madras Mahajan Sabha was founded in 1884 by
M. Viraraghavachari, B. Subramaniya Aiyer and P. Anandacharlu.

246  

Pre-Congress Campaigns
The associations organised various campaigns before the
Indian National Congress appeared on the scene. These
campaigns were—
(i) for imposition of import duty on cotton (1875)
(ii) for Indianisation of government service (1878-79)
(iii) against Lytton’s Afghan adventure
(iv) against Arms Act (1878)
(v) against Vernacular Press Act (1878)
(vi) for right to join volunteer corps
(vii) against plantation labour and against Inland Emigration
Act
(viii) in support of Ilbert Bill
(ix) for an All India Fund for Political Agitation
(x) campaign in Britain to vote for pro-India party
(xi) against reduction in maximum age for appearing in
Indian Civil Service; the Indian Association took up
this question and organised an all-India agitation
against it, popularly known as the Indian Civil
Service agitation.

Chapter 11

Indian National
Congress: Foundation
and the Moderate Phase
Foundation of Indian National
Congress
In the later 1870s and early 1880s, a solid ground had been
prepared for the establishment of an all-India organisation.
The final shape to this idea was given by a retired English
civil servant, A.O. Hume, who mobilised leading intellectuals
of the time and, with their cooperation, organised the first
session of the Indian National Congress at Gokuldas Tejpal
Sanskrit College in Bombay in December 1885. As a prelude
to this, two sessions of the Indian National Conference had
been held in 1883 and 1885, which had representatives drawn
from all major towns of India. Surendranath Banerjea and
Ananda Mohan Bose were the main architects of the Indian
National Conference.
The first session of the Indian National Congress was
attended by 72 delegates and presided over by Womesh
Chandra Bonnerjee. Hereafter, the Congress met every year
in December, in a different part of the country each time.
Some of the great presidents of the Congress during this
early phase were Dadabhai Naoroji (thrice president),
247

248  

Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozshah Mehta, P. Anandacharlu,
Surendranath Banerjea, Romesh Chandra Dutt, Ananda Mohan
Bose and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Other prominent leaders
included Mahadeo Govind Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Sisir
Kumar Ghosh, Motilal Ghosh, Madan Mohan Malaviya,
G. Subramaniya Aiyar, C. Vijayaraghavachariar, Dinshaw E.
Wacha.
In 1890, Kadambini Ganguly, the first woman graduate
of Calcutta University, addressed the Congress session,
which symbolised the commitment of the freedom struggle
to give the women of India their due status in national life.
Apart from the Indian National Congress, nationalist
activity was carried out through provincial conferences and
associations, newspapers and literature.

Was It a Safety Valve?

There is a theory that Hume formed the Congress with the
idea that it would prove to be a ‘safety valve’ for releasing
the growing discontent of the Indians. To this end, he
convinced Lord Dufferin not to obstruct the formation of
the Congress. The extremist leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai
believed in the ‘safety valve’ theory. Even the Marxist
historian’s ‘conspiracy theory’ was an offspring of the ‘safety
valve’ notion. For example, R.P. Dutt opined that the Indian
National Congress was born out of a conspiracy to abort a
popular uprising in India and the bourgeois leaders were a
party to it.
Modern Indian historians, however, dispute the idea of
‘safety valve’. In their opinion the Indian National Congress
represented the urge of the politically conscious Indians to
set up a national body to express the political and economic
demands of the Indians. If the Indians had convened such a
body on their own, there would have been unsurmountable
opposition from the officials; such an organisation would not
have been allowed to form. In the circumstances, as Bipan
Chandra observes, the early Congress leaders used Hume as
a ‘lightning conductor’ i.e., as a catalyst to bring together
the nationalistic forces even if under the guise of a ‘safety
valve’.

Indian National Congress  249

Aims and Objectives of the Congress

The main aims of the Indian National Congress in the initial
stage were to—
(i) found a democratic, nationalist movement;
(ii) politicise and politically educate people;
(iii) establish the headquarters for a movement;
(iv) promote friendly relations among nationalist
political workers from different parts of the
country;
(v) develop and propagate an anti-colonial nationalist
ideology;
(vi) formulate and present popular demands before the
government with a view to unifying the people
over a common economic and political
programme;
(vii) develop and consolidate a feeling of national unity
among people irrespective of religion, caste or
province.
(viii) carefully promote and nurture Indian nationhood.

Era of Moderates (1885-1905)
Important Leaders

The national leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozshah
Mehta, D.E. Wacha, W.C. Bonnerjea, S.N. Banerjea who
dominated the Congress policies during the early period
(1885-1905) were staunch believers in ‘liberalism’ and
‘moderate’ politics and came to be labelled as Moderates to
distinguish them from the neo-nationalists of the early
twentieth century who were referred to as the Extremists.

Moderate Approach

The moderate political activity involved constitutional agitation
within the confines of law and showed a slow but orderly
political progress. The Moderates believed that the British
basically wanted to be just to the Indians but were not aware
of the real conditions. Therefore, if public opinion could be
created in the country and public demands be presented to
the government through resolutions, petitions, meetings, etc.,
the authorities would concede these demands gradually.

250  

To achieve these ends, they worked on a two-pronged
methodology—one, create a strong public opinion to arouse
consciousness and national spirit and then educate and unite
people on common political questions; and two, persuade the
British Government and British public opinion to introduce
reforms in India on the lines laid out by the nationalists. They
used the method of ‘prayer and petition’ and if that failed,
they resorted to constitutional agitation.
A British committee of the Indian National Congress
was established in London in 1889 which had India as its
organ. Dadabhai Naoroji spent a substantial portion of his
life and income campaigning for India’s case abroad. In 1890,
it was decided to hold a session of the Indian National
Congress in London in 1892, but owing to the British
elections of 1891 the proposal was postponed and never
revived later.
The Moderate leaders believed that political connections
with Britain were in India’s interest at that stage of history
and that the time was not ripe for a direct challenge to the
British rule. Therefore, it was considered to be appropriate
to try and transform the colonial rule to be as close to a
national rule as possible.

Contributions of Moderate
Nationalists
Economic Critique of British Imperialism

The early nationalists, led by Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt,
Dinshaw Wacha and others, carefully analysed the political
economy of British rule in India, and put forward the “drain
theory” to explain British exploitation of India. They opposed
the transformation of a basically self-sufficient Indian economy
into a colonial economy (i.e., a supplier of raw materials and
food stuff, an importer of finished goods and a field of
investment for British capital). Thus, the Moderates were able
to create an all-India public opinion that British rule in India
was the major cause of India’s poverty and economic
backwardness.
To mitigate the deprivation characterising Indian life,

Indian National Congress  251

the early nationalists demanded severance of India’s economic
subservience to Britain and development of an independent
economy through involvement of Indian capital and enterprise.
The early nationalists demanded reduction in land revenue,
abolition of salt tax, improvement in working conditions of
plantation labour, reduction in military expenditure, and
encouragement to modern industry through tariff
protection and direct government aid. (Also refer to chapter
on Economic Impact of British Rule in India.)

Constitutional Reforms and Propaganda in
Legislature

Legislative councils in India had no real official power till
1920. Yet, work done in them by the nationalists helped the
growth of the national movement. The Imperial Legislative
Council constituted by the Indian Councils Act (1861) was
an impotent body designed to disguise official measures as
having been passed by a representative body. Indian members
were few in number—in the thirty years from 1862 to 1892
only forty-five Indians were nominated to it, most of them
being wealthy, landed and with loyalist interests. Only a
handful of political figures and independent intellectuals such
as Syed Ahmed Khan, Kristodas Pal, V.N. Mandlik, K.L.
Nulkar and Rashbehari Ghosh were among those nominated.
From 1885 to 1892, the nationalist demands for
constitutional reforms were centred around—
1. expansion of councils—i.e., greater participation of
Indians in councils; and
2. reform of councils—i.e., more powers to councils,
especially greater control over finances.
The early nationalists worked with the long-term
objective of a democratic self-government. Their demands
for constitutional reforms were meant to have been conceded
in 1892 in the form of the Indian Councils Act.
These reforms were severely criticised at Congress
sessions, where the nationalists made no secret of their
dissatisfaction with them. Now, they demanded (i) a majority
of elected Indians, and (ii) control over the budget, i.e., the
power to vote upon and amend the budget. They gave the
slogan—“No taxation without representation”. Gradually, the

252  

Indian Councils Act 1892
Main Provisions
● Number of additional members in Imperial Legislative Councils
and the Provincial Legislative Councils was raised. In Imperial
Legislative Council, now the governor-general could have ten
to sixteen non-officials (instead of six to ten previously).
● The non-official members of the Indian legislative council were
to be nominated by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and
provincial legislative councils. The members could be
recommended by universities, municipalities, zamindars and
chambers of commerce. So the principle of representation was
introduced.
● Budget could be discussed.
● Questions could be asked.
Limitations
● The officials retained their majority in the council, thus making
ineffective the non-official voice.
● The ‘reformed’ Imperial Legislative Council met, during its tenure
till 1909, on an average for only thirteen days in a year, and
the number of unofficial Indian members present was only five
out of twenty-four.
● The budget could not be voted upon, nor could any amendments
be made to it.
● Supplementaries could not be asked, nor could answers to any
question be discussed.

scope of constitutional demands was widened. Dadabhai
Naoroji (1904), Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1905) and Lokmanya
Tilak (1906) demanded self-government on the lines of the
self-governing colonies of Canada and Australia. Also, leaders
like Pherozshah Mehta and Gokhale put government policies
and proposals to severe criticism.
The British had intended to use the councils to
incorporate the more vocal among Indian leaders, so as to
allow them to let off their “political steam”, while the
impotent councils could afford to remain deaf to their
criticism. But the nationalists were able to transform these
councils into forums for ventilating popular grievances, for
exposing the defects of an indifferent bureaucracy, for
criticising government policies/proposals, raising basic
economic issues, especially regarding public finance.
The nationalists were, thus, able to enhance their

Indian National Congress  253

political stature and build a national movement while
undermining the political and moral influence of imperialist
rule. This helped in generating anti-imperialist sentiments
among the public. But, at the same time, the nationalists
failed to widen the democratic base of the movement by not
including the masses, especially women, and not demanding
the right to vote for all.

Campaign for General Administrative
Reforms

The Moderates campaigned on the following grounds:
(i) Indianisation of government service: on the economic
grounds that British civil servants got very high emoluments
while inclusion of Indians would be more economical; on
political grounds that, since salaries of British bureaucrats
were remitted back home and pensions paid in England (all
drawn from Indian revenue), this amounted to economic drain
of national resources; and on moral grounds that Indians
were being discriminated against by being kept away from
positions of trust and responsibility.
(ii) Call for separation of judicial from executive
functions.
(iii) Criticism of an oppressive and tyrannical
bureaucracy and an expensive and time-consuming judicial
system.
(iv) Criticism of an aggressive foreign policy which
resulted in annexation of Burma, attack on Afghanistan and
suppression of tribals in the North-West—all costing heavily
for the Indian treasury.
(v) Call for increase in expenditure on welfare (i.e.,
health, sanitation), education—especially elementary and
technical—irrigation works and improvement of agriculture,
agricultural banks for cultivators, etc.
(vi) Demand for better treatment for Indian labour
abroad in other British colonies, where they faced oppression
and racial discrimination.

Protection of Civil Rights

Civil rights included the right to speech, thought, association
and a free press. Through an incessant campaign, the nationalists
were able to spread modern democratic ideas, and soon the

—Justice Mahadeo Govind Ranade to Gokhale (1891)

defence of civil rights became an integral part of the freedom
struggle. It was due to the increased consciousness that there
was a great public outrage at the arrest of Tilak and several
other leaders and journalists in 1897 and at the arrest and
deportation of the Natu brothers without a trial. (Also refer
to chapter on Development of Press in India.)

An Evaluation of the
Early Nationalists
The early nationalists did a great deal to awaken the national
sentiment, even though they could not draw the masses to
them.
(i) They represented the most progressive forces of the
time.
(ii) They were able to create a wide national awakening
of all Indians having common interests and the need to rally
around a common programme against a common enemy, and
above all, the feeling of belonging to one nation.
(iii) They trained people in political work and popularised
modern ideas.
(iv) They exposed the basically exploitative character
of colonial rule, thus undermining its moral foundations.
(v) Their political work was based on hard realities, and
not on shallow sentiments, religion, etc.
(vi) They were able to establish the basic political truth
that India should be ruled in the interest of Indians.
(vii) They created a solid base for a more vigorous,
militant, mass-based national movement in the years that
followed.
(viii) However, they failed to widen their democratic
base and the scope of their demands.

Indian National Congress  255

Role of Masses

The moderate phase of the national movement had a narrow
social base and the masses played a passive role. This was
because the early nationalists lacked political faith in the
masses; they felt that there were numerous divisions and subdivisions in the Indian society, and the masses were generally
ignorant and had conservative ideas and thoughts. The
Moderates felt that these heterogeneous elements had first
to be welded into a nation before they entered the political
sphere. But they failed to realise that it was only during a
freedom struggle and with political participation that these
diverse elements could come together.
Because of the lack of mass participation, the Moderates
could not take militant political positions against the authorities. The later nationalists differed from the Moderates
precisely on this point. Still, the early nationalists represented
the emerging Indian nation against colonial interests.

Attitude of the Government

The British Indian Government was hostile to the Congress
from the beginning despite the latter’s moderate methods and
emphasis on loyalty to the British Crown. The official
attitude stiffened further after 1887 when the government
failed to persuade the Congress to confine itself to social
issues when the Congress was becoming increasingly critical

of the colonial rule. Now, the government resorted to open
condemnation of the Congress, calling the nationalists
“seditious brahmins”, “disloyal babus”, etc. Dufferin called
the Congress “a factory of sedition”. Later, the government
adopted a ‘divide and rule’ policy towards the Congress. The
officials encouraged reactionary elements like Sir Syed
Ahmed Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad Singh of Benaras to
organise the United Indian Patriotic Association to counter
Congress propaganda. The government also tried to divide the
nationalists on the basis of religion, and, through a policy
of ‘carrot and stick’, pitted the Moderates against the
Extremists. But the government failed to check the rising tide
of nationalism.

Era of Militant
Nationalism (1905-1909)
Growth of Militant Nationalism
A radical trend of a militant nationalist approach to political
activity started emerging in the 1890s and it took a concrete
shape by 1905. As an adjunct to this trend, a revolutionary
wing also took shape.

Why Militant Nationalism Grew

Many factors contributed to the rise of militant nationalism.
Recognition of the True Nature of British Rule
Having seen that the British government was not conceding
any of their important demands, the more militant among
257

258  

those politically conscious got disillusioned and started
looking for a more effective mode of political action. Also,
the feeling that only an Indian government could lead India
on to a path of progress started attracting more and more
people. The economic miseries of the 1890s further exposed
the exploitative character of colonial rule. Severe famines
killed 90 lakh persons between 1896 and 1900. Bubonic
plague affected large areas of the Deccan. There were largescale riots in the Deccan.
The nationalists were wide awake to the fact that instead
of giving more rights to the Indians, the government was
taking away even the existing ones.
1892 — The Indian Councils Act was criticised by
nationalists as it failed to satisfy them.
1897 — The Natu brothers were deported without trial
and Tilak and others, imprisoned on charges
of sedition.
1898 — Repressive laws under IPC Section 124 A
were further amplified with new provisions
under IPC Section 156 A
1899 — Number of Indian members in Calcutta
Corporation were reduced.
1904 — Official Secrets Act curbed freedom of press.
1904 — Indian Universities Act ensured greater
government control over universities, which
it described as factories producing political
revolutionaries.
Also, British rule was no longer progressive socially
and culturally. It was suppressing the spread of education,
especially mass and technical education.
Growth of Confidence and Self-Respect
There was a growing faith in self-effort. Tilak, Aurobindo and
Bipin Chandra Pal repeatedly urged the nationalists to rely
on the character and capacities of the Indian people. A feeling
started gaining currency that the masses had to be involved
in the battle against colonial government as they were capable
of making the immense sacrifices needed to win freedom.
Growth of Education
While, on the one hand, the spread of education led to an
increased awareness among the masses, on the other hand,

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  259

the rise in unemployment and underemployment among the
educated drew attention to poverty and the underdeveloped
state of the country’s economy under colonial rule. This
added to the already simmering discontent among the more
radical nationalists.
International Influences
Remarkable progress made by Japan after 1868 and its
emergence as an industrial power opened the eyes of Indians
to the fact that economic progress was possible even in an
Asian country without any external help. The defeat of the
Italian army by Ethiopians (1896), the Boer wars (18991902) where the British faced reverses and Japan’s victory
over Russia (1905) demolished myths of European
invincibility. Also, the nationalists were inspired by the
nationalist movements worldwide—in Ireland, Russia, Egypt,
Turkey, Persia and China. The Indians realised that a united
people willing to make sacrifices could take on the mightiest
of empires.
Reaction to Increasing Westernisation
The new leadership felt the stranglehold of excessive
westernisation and sensed colonial designs to submerge the
Indian national identity in the British Empire. The intellectual
and moral inspiration of the new leadership was Indian.
Intellectuals like Swami Vivekananda, Bankim Chandra
Chatterjee and Swami Dayananda Saraswati inspired many
young nationalists with their forceful and articulate arguments,
painting India’s past in brighter colours than the British
ideologues had. These thinkers exploded the myth of western
superiority by referring to the richness of Indian civilisation
in the past. Dayananda’s political message was ‘India for the
Indians’.
Dissatisfaction with Achievements of Moderates
The younger elements within the Congress were dissatisfied
with the achievements of the Moderates during the first 1520 years. They were strongly critical of the methods of
peaceful and constitutional agitation, popularly known as the
“Three ‘P’s”—prayer, petition and protest—and described
these methods as ‘political mendicancy’.

Karachi Chronicle (June 18, 1905)

Reactionary Policies of Curzon
A sharp reaction was created in the Indian mind by Curzon’s
seven-year rule in India which was full of missions,
commissions and omissions. He refused to recognise India
as a nation, and insulted Indian nationalists and the intelligentsia
by describing their activities as “letting off of gas”. He spoke
derogatorily of Indian character in general. Administrative
measures adopted during his rule—the Official Secrets Act,
the Indian Universities Act, the Calcutta Corporation Act and,
above all, the partition of Bengal—left no doubt in Indian
minds about the basically reactionary nature of British rule
in India.
Existence of a Militant School of Thought
By the dawn of the twentieth century, a band of nationalist
thinkers had emerged who advocated a more militant approach
to political work. These included Raj Narain Bose, Ashwini
Kumar Datta, Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal in
Bengal; Vishnu Shastri Chiplunkar and Bal Gangadhar Tilak
in Maharashtra; and Lala Lajpat Rai in Punjab. Tilak emerged
as the most outstanding representative of this school of
thought.
The basic tenets of this school of thought were:
● hatred for foreign rule; since no hope could be
derived from it, Indians should work out their own
salvation;
● swaraj to be the goal of national movement;
● direct political action required;

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  261

belief in capacity of the masses to challenge the
authority;
● personal sacrifices required and a true nationalist to
be always ready for it.
Emergence of a Trained Leadership
The new leadership could provide a proper channelisation of
the immense potential for political struggle which the masses
possessed and, as the militant nationalists thought, were ready
to give expression to. This energy of the masses got a release
during the movement against the partition of Bengal, which
acquired the form of the swadeshi agitation.
●

The Swadeshi and Boycott
Movement
The Swadeshi Movement had its genesis in the anti-partition
movement which was started to oppose the British decision
to partition Bengal.

Partition of Bengal to Divide People

The British government’s decision to partition Bengal had
been made public in December 1903. The idea was to have
two provinces: Bengal comprising Western Bengal as well
as the provinces of Bihar and Orissa, and Eastern Bengal and
Assam. Bengal retained Calcutta as its capital, while Dacca
became the capital of Eastern Bengal. The official reason
given for the decision was that Bengal with a population of
78 million (about a quarter of the population of British India)
had become too big to be administered. It was also stated
that partition would help in the development of Assam if it
came under the direct jurisdiction of the government. This
was true to some extent, but the real motive behind the
partition plan was seen to be the British desire to weaken
Bengal, the nerve centre of Indian nationalism. This it sought
to achieve by putting the Bengalis under two administrations
by dividing them:
(i) on the basis of language, thus reducing the Bengalis
to a minority in Bengal itself (as in the new
proposal Bengal proper was to have 17 million

Bengalis and 37 million Hindi and Oriya speakers);
and
(ii) on the basis of religion, as the western half was
to be a Hindu majority area (42 million out of a
total 54 million) and the eastern half was to be a
Muslim majority area (18 million out of a total of
31 million).
Trying to woo the Muslims, Curzon, the viceroy at that
time, argued that Dacca could become the capital of the new
Muslim majority province, which would provide them with
a unity not experienced by them since the days of old Muslim
viceroys and kings. Thus, it was clear that the government
was up to its old policy of propping up Muslim communalists
to counter the Congress and the national movement.

Anti-Partition Campaign Under
Moderates (1903-05)
In the period 1903-1905, the leadership was provided by men
like Surendranath Banerjea, K.K. Mitra and Prithwishchandra
Ray. The methods adopted were petitions to the government,
public meetings, memoranda, and propaganda through
pamphlets and newspapers such as Hitabadi, Sanjibani and
Bengalee. Their objective was to exert sufficient pressure
on the government through an educated public opinion in
India and England to prevent the unjust partition of Bengal
from being implemented.
Ignoring a loud public opinion against the partition
proposal, the government announced partition of Bengal in
July 1905. Within days, protest meetings were held in small
towns all over Bengal. It was in these meetings that the pledge
to boycott foreign goods was first taken. On August 7, 1905,
with the passage of the Boycott Resolution in a massive
meeting held in the Calcutta Townhall, the formal

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  263

proclamation of Swadeshi Movement was made. After
this, the leaders dispersed to other parts of Bengal to
propagate the message of boycott of Manchester cloth and
Liverpool salt.
October 16, 1905, the day the partition formally came
into force, was observed as a day of mourning throughout
Bengal. People fasted, bathed in the Ganga and walked
barefoot in processions singing Bande Mataram (which
almost spontaneously became the theme song of the
movement). ‘Amar Sonar Bangla’, the national anthem of
present-day Bangladesh, was composed by Rabindranath
Tagore, and was sung by huge crowds marching in the streets.
People tied rakhis on each other’s hands as a symbol of unity
of the two halves of Bengal. Later in the day, Surendranath
Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose addressed huge gatherings
(perhaps the largest till then under the nationalist banner).
Within a few hours of the meeting, Rs 50,000 was raised
for the movement.
Soon, the movement spread to other parts of the
country—in Poona and Bombay under Tilak, in Punjab under
Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh, in Delhi under Syed Haider
Raza, and in Madras under Chidambaram Pillai.

The Congress’s Position

The Indian National Congress, meeting in 1905 under the
presidentship of Gokhale, resolved to (i) condemn the
partition of Bengal and the reactionary policies of Curzon,
and (ii) support the anti-partition and Swadeshi Movement
of Bengal.
The militant nationalists led by Tilak, Lajpat Rai, Bipin
Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh wanted the movement to
be taken outside Bengal to other parts of the country and
go beyond a boycott of foreign goods to become a fullfledged political mass struggle with the goal of attaining
swaraj. But the Moderates, dominating the Congress at that
time, were not willing to go that far. However, a big step
forward was taken at the Congress session held at Calcutta
(1906) under the presidentship of Dadabhai Naoroji, where
it was declared that the goal of the Indian National Congress
was “self-government or swaraj like the United Kingdom or

264  

the colonies” of Australia or Canada. The Moderate-Extremist
dispute over the pace of the movement and techniques of
struggle reached a deadlock at the Surat session of the Indian
National Congress (1907) where the party split with serious
consequences for the Swadeshi Movement.

The Movement under
Extremist Leadership
After 1905, the Extremists acquired a dominant influence
over the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal. There were three
reasons for this:
(i) The Moderate-led movement had failed to yield
results.
(ii) The divisive tactics of the governments of both the
Bengals had embittered the nationalists.
(iii) The government had resorted to suppressive
measures, which included atrocities on students—many of
whom were given corporal punishment; ban on public singing
of Vande Mataram; restriction on public meetings;
prosecution and long imprisonment of swadeshi workers;
clashes between the police and the people in many towns;
arrests and deportation of leaders; and suppression of freedom
of the press.

The Extremist Programme
Emboldened by Dadabhai Naoroji’s declaration at the Calcutta
session (1906) that self-government or swaraj was to be the
goal of the Congress, the Extremists gave a call for passive
resistance in addition to swadeshi and boycott which would
include a boycott of government schools and colleges,
government service, courts, legislative councils,
municipalities, government titles, etc. The purpose, as
Aurobindo put it, was to “make the administration under
present conditions impossible by an organised refusal to do
anything which will help either the British commerce in the
exploitation of the country or British officialdom in the
administration of it”.
The militant nationalists tried to transform the antipartition and Swadeshi Movement into a mass struggle and

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  265

gave the slogan of India’s independence from foreign rule.
“Political freedom is the lifebreath of a nation,” declared
Aurobindo. Thus, the Extremists gave the idea of India’s
independence the central place in India’s politics. The goal
of independence was to be achieved through self-sacrifice.

New Forms of Struggle and Impact
The militant nationalists put forward several fresh ideas at
the theoretical, propaganda and programme levels. Among the
several forms of struggle thrown up by the movement were
the following.
Boycott of Foreign Goods
Boycott included boycott and public burning of foreign cloth,
boycott of foreign-made salt or sugar, refusal by priests to
ritualise marriages involving exchange of foreign goods,
refusal by washermen to wash foreign clothes. This form of
protest met with great success at the practical and popular
level.
Public Meetings and Processions
Public meetings and processions emerged as major methods
of mass mobilisation. Simultaneously they were forms of
popular expression.
Corps of Volunteers or ‘Samitis’
Samitis such as the Swadesh Bandhab Samiti of Ashwini
Kumar Dutta (in Barisal) emerged as a very popular and
powerful means of mass mobilisation. In Tirunelveli, Tamil
Nadu, V.O. Chidambaram Pillai, Subramania Siva and some
lawyers formed the Swadeshi Sangam which inspired the local
masses. These samitis generated political consciousness
among the masses through magic lantern lectures, swadeshi
songs, providing physical and moral training to their members,
social work during famines and epidemics, organisation of
schools, training in swadeshi crafts and arbitration courts.
Imaginative use of Traditional Popular
Festivals and Melas
The idea was to use traditional festivals and occasions as a
means of reaching out to the masses and spreading political
messages. For instance, Tilak’s Ganapati and Shivaji festivals

266  

became a medium of swadeshi propaganda not only in western
India, but also in Bengal. In Bengal also, the traditional folk
theatre forms were used for this purpose.
Emphasis given to Self-Reliance
Self-reliance or ‘atma shakti’ was encouraged. This implied
re-assertion of national dignity, honour and confidence and
social and economic regeneration of the villages. In practical
terms, it included social reform and campaigns against caste
oppression, early marriage, dowry system, consumption of
alcohol, etc.
Programme of Swadeshi or National Education
Bengal National College, inspired by Tagore’s Shantiniketan,
was set up with Aurobindo Ghosh as its principal. Soon
national schools and colleges sprang up in various parts of
the country. On August 15, 1906, the National Council of
Education was set up to organise a system of education—
literary, scientific and technical—on national lines and under
national control. Education was to be imparted through the
vernacular medium. A Bengal Institute of Technology was set
up for technical education and funds were raised to send
students to Japan for advanced learning.
Swadeshi or Indigenous Enterprises
The swadeshi spirit also found expression in the establishment
of swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories, tanneries,
Views
Swaraj or self-government is essential for the exercise of
swadharma. Without swaraj there could be no social reform, no
industrial progress, no useful education, no fulfilment of national
life. That is what we seek, that is why God has sent us to
the world to fulfil Him.
—B.G. Tilak
Swadeshism during the days of its potency coloured the entire
texture of our social and domestic life.
—Surendranath Banerjea
Swaraj is the fulfilment of the ancient life of India under modern
conditions, the return of satyuga of national greatness, the
resumption by her of her great role of the teacher and guide,
self-liberation of the people for final fulfilment of the Vedantic
idea in politics, that is the true swaraj for India.
—Aurobindo Ghosh

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  267

banks, insurance companies, shops, etc. These enterprises
were based more on patriotic zeal than on business acumen.
V.O. Chidambaram Pillai’s venture into a national shipbuilding
enterprise—Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company—at
Tuticorin, however, gave a challenge to the British Indian
Steam Navigation Company.
Impact in the Cultural Sphere
The nationalists of all hues took inspiration from songs
written by Rabindranath Tagore, Rajnikant Sen, Dwijendralal
Ray, Mukunda Das, Syed Abu Mohammad and others. Tagore’s
Amar Sonar Bangla written on this occasion was later to
inspire the liberation struggle of Bangladesh and was adopted
by it as its national anthem. In Tamil Nadu, Subramania
Bharati wrote Sudesha Geetham.
In painting, Abanindranath Tagore broke the domination
of Victorian naturalism over the Indian art scene and took
inspiration from Ajanta, Mughal and Rajput paintings. Nandalal
Bose, who left a major imprint on Indian art, was the first
recipient of a scholarship offered by the Indian Society of
Oriental Art, founded in 1907.
In science, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Prafullachandra Roy
and others pioneered original research which was praised the
world over.

Extent of Mass Participation

Students Students came out in large numbers to
propagate and practise swadeshi, and to take a lead in
organising picketing of shops selling foreign goods. Student
participation was visible in Bengal, Maharashtra, especially
in Poona, and in many parts of the South—Guntur, Madras,
Salem. Police adopted a repressive attitude towards the
students. Schools and colleges whose students participated
in the agitation were to be penalised by disaffiliating them
or stopping of grants and privileges to them. Students who
were found guilty of participation were to be disqualified for
government jobs or for government scholarships, and
disciplinary action—fine, expulsion, arrest, beating, etc.—
was to be taken against them.
Women Women, who were traditionally home-centred,
especially those of the urban middle classes, took active part

268  

in processions and picketing. From now onwards, they were
to play a significant role in the national movement.
Stand of Muslims Some of the Muslims participated—
Barrister Abdul Rasul, Liaqat Hussain, Guznavi, Maulana Azad
(who joined one of the revolutionary terrorist groups); but
most of the upper and middle class Muslims stayed away or,
led by Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, supported the partition
on the plea that it would give them a Muslim-majority East
Bengal. To further government interests, the All India Muslim
League was propped up on December 30, 1905 as an antiCongress front, and reactionary elements like Nawab
Salimullah of Dacca were encouraged. Also, the nature of
the Swadeshi Movement, with leaders evoking Hindu festivals
and goddesses for inspiration, tended to exclude the Muslims.
Labour Unrest and Trade Unions In the beginning,
some strikes were organised on the issue of rising prices
and racial insult, primarily in the foreign owned companies.
In September 1905, more than 250 Bengali clerks of the Burn
Company, Howrah, walked out in protest against a derogatory
work regulation. In July 1906, a strike of workers in the East
Indian Railway, resulted in the formation of a Railwaymen’s
Union. Between 1906 and 1908, strikes in the jute mills were
very frequent, at times affecting 18 out of 18 mills.
Subramania Siva and Chidambaram Pillai led strikes in
Tuticorin and Tirunelveli in a foreign-owned cotton mill. In
Rawalpindi (Punjab), the arsenal and railway workers went
on strike led by Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh. However,
by summer of 1908, the labour unrests subsided under strict
action.
Thus, the social base of the movement expanded to
include certain sections of the zamindari, the students, the
women, and the lower middle classes in cities and towns.
An attempt was also made to give political expression to
economic grievances of the working class by organising
strikes. But the movement was not able to garner support
of the Muslims, especially the Muslim peasantry, because
of a conscious government policy of divide and rule helped
by overlap of class and community at places.

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  269

All India Aspect

Movements in support of Bengal’s unity and the swadeshi
and boycott agitation were organised in many parts of the
country. Tilak, who played a leading role in the spread of
the movement outside Bengal, saw in this the ushering in of
a new chapter in the history of the national movement. He
realised that here was a challenge and an opportunity to
organise popular mass struggle against the British rule to
unite the country in a bond of common sympathy.

Annulment of Partition
It was decided to annul the partition of Bengal in 1911 mainly
to curb the menace of revolutionary terrorism. The annulment
came as a rude shock to the Muslim political elite. It was
also decided to shift the capital to Delhi as a sop to the
Muslims, as it was associated with Muslim glory, but the
Muslims were not pleased. Bihar and Orissa were taken out
of Bengal and Assam was made a separate province.

Evaluation of the
Swadeshi Movement
The Movement Fizzles Out

By 1908, the open phase (as different from the underground
revolutionary phase) of the Swadeshi and Boycott movement
was almost over. This was due to many reasons—
● There was severe government repression.
● The movement failed to create an effective organisation
or a party structure. It threw up an entire gamut of techniques
that later came to be associated with Gandhian politics—noncooperation, passive resistance, filling of British jails, social
reform and constructive work—but failed to give these
techniques a disciplined focus.
● The movement was rendered leaderless with most of
the leaders either arrested or deported by 1908 and with
Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal retiring from active
politics.
● Internal squabbles among leaders, magnified by the
Surat split (1907), did much harm to the movement.

270  
● The movement aroused the people but did not know
how to tap the newly released energy or how to find new
forms to give expression to popular resentment.
● The movement largely remained confined to the upper
and middle classes and zamindars, and failed to reach the
masses—especially the peasantry.
● Non-cooperation and passive resistance remained
mere ideas.
● It is difficult to sustain a mass-based movement at
a high pitch for too long.

Movement a Turning Point

Despite its gradual decline into inactivity, the movement was
a turning point in modern Indian history.
● It proved to be a “leap forward” in more ways than
one. Hitherto untouched sections—students, women, workers,
some sections of urban and rural population—participated.
All the major trends of the national movement, from
conservative moderation to political extremism, from
revolutionary activities to incipient socialism, from petitions
and prayers to passive resistance and non-cooperation, emerged
during the Swadeshi Movement.
● The richness of the movement was not confined to
the political sphere, but encompassed art, literature, science
and industry also.
● People were aroused from slumber and now they
learned to take bold political positions and participate in new
forms of political work.
● The swadeshi campaign undermined the hegemony of
colonial ideas and institutions.
● The future struggle was to draw heavily from the
experience gained.
Moderate Methods Give Way to
Extremist Modes
With the coming of Swadeshi and Boycott Movement, it
became clear that the Moderates had outlived their utility and
their politics of petitions and speeches had become obsolete.
They had not succeeded in keeping pace with time, and this
was highlighted by their failure to get the support of the
younger generation for their style of politics. Their failure

to work among the masses had meant that their ideas did not
take root among the masses. Even the propaganda by the
Moderates did not reach the masses. No all-India campaigns
of the scale of Swadeshi and Boycott Movement had been
organised earlier by the Moderates and, in this campaign, they
discovered that they were not its leaders, which was rather
natural.

272  

The Extremist ideology and its functioning also lacked
consistency. Its advocates ranged from open members and
secret sympathisers to those opposed to any kind of political
violence. Its leaders—Aurobindo, Tilak, B.C. Pal and Lala
Lajpat Rai—had different perceptions of their goal. For Tilak,
swaraj meant some sort of self-government, while for
Aurobindo it meant complete independence from foreign
rule. But at the politico-ideological level, their emphasis on
mass participation and on the need to broaden the social base
of the movement was a progressive improvement upon the
Moderate politics. They raised patriotism from a level of
‘academic pastime’ to one of ‘service and sacrifice for the
country’. But the politically progressive Extremists proved
to be social reactionaries. They had revivalist and obscurantist
undertones attached to their thoughts. Tilak’s opposition to
the Age of Consent Bill (which would have raised the
marriageable age for girls from 10 years to 12 years, even
though his objection was mainly that such reforms must come
from people governing themselves and not under an alien
rule), his organising of Ganapati and Shivaji festivals as
national festivals, his support to anti-cow killing campaigns,
etc., portrayed him as a Hindu nationalist. Similarly B.C. Pal
and Aurobindo spoke of a Hindu nation and Hindu interests.
This alienated many Muslims from the movement.
Though the seemingly revivalist and obscurantist tactics
of the Extremists were directed against the foreign rulers,
they had the effect of promoting a very unhealthy relationship
between politics and religion, the bitter harvests of which
the Indians had to reap in later years.

The Surat Split
The Congress split at Surat came in December 1907, around
the time when revolutionary activity had gained momentum.
The two events were not unconnected.

Run-up to Surat
In December 1905, at the Benaras session of the Indian
National Congress presided over by Gokhale, the ModerateExtremist differences came to the fore. The Extremists
wanted to extend the Boycott and Swadeshi Movement to

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  273

regions outside Bengal and also to include all forms of
associations (such as government service, law courts,
legislative councils, etc.) within the boycott programme and
thus start a nationwide mass movement. The Extremists
wanted a strong resolution supporting their programme at the
Benaras session. The Moderates, on the other hand, were not
in favour of extending the movement beyond Bengal and were
totally opposed to boycott of councils and similar associations.
They advocated constitutional methods to protest against the
partition of Bengal. As a compromise, a relatively mild
resolution condemning the partition of Bengal and the
reactionary policies of Curzon and supporting the swadeshi
and boycott programme in Bengal was passed. This succeeded
in averting a split for the moment.
At the Calcutta session of the Congress in December
1906, the Moderate enthusiasm had cooled a bit because of
the popularity of the Extremists and the revolutionaries and
because of communal riots. Here, the Extremists wanted
either Tilak or Lajpat Rai as the president, while the
Moderates proposed the name of Dadabhai Naoroji, who was
widely respected by all the nationalists. Finally, Dadabhai
Naoroji was elected as the president and as a concession to
the militants, the goal of the Indian National Congress was
defined as ‘swarajya or self-government’ like the United
Kingdom or the colonies of Australia and Canada. Also a
resolution supporting the programme of swadeshi, boycott
and national education was passed. The word swaraj was
mentioned for the first time, but its connotation was not spelt
out, which left the field open for differing interpretations
by the Moderates and the Extremists.
The Extremists, encouraged by the proceedings at the
Calcutta session, gave a call for wide passive resistance and
boycott of schools, colleges, legislative councils,
municipalities, law courts, etc. The Moderates, encouraged
by the news that council reforms were on the anvil, decided
to tone down the Calcutta programme. The two sides seemed
to be heading for a showdown.
The Extremists thought that the people had been
aroused and the battle for freedom had begun. They felt the
time had come for the big push to drive the British out and

274  

considered the Moderates to be a drag on the movement.
They decided that it was necessary to part company with the
Moderates, even if it meant a split in the Congress.
The Moderates thought that it would be dangerous at
that stage to associate with the Extremists whose antiimperialist agitation, it was felt, would be ruthlessly suppressed
by the mighty colonial forces. The Moderates saw in the
council reforms an opportunity to realise their dream of
Indian participation in the administration. Any hasty action
by the Congress, the Moderates felt, under Extremist pressure
was bound to annoy the Liberals, then in power in England.
The Moderates were also ready to part company with the
Extremists.
The Moderates failed to realise that the council reforms
were meant by the government more to isolate the Extremists
than to reward the Moderates. The Extremists did not realise
that the Moderates could act as their front line of defence
against state repression. And neither side realised that in a
vast country like India ruled by a strong imperialist power,
only a broad-based nationalist movement could succeed.

Split Takes Place

The Extremists wanted the 1907 session to be held in Nagpur
(Central Provinces) with Tilak or Lajpat Rai as the president
along with a reiteration of the swadeshi, boycott and national
education resolutions. The Moderates wanted the session at
Surat in order to exclude Tilak from the presidency, since
a leader from the host province could not be session
president (Surat being in Tilak’s home province of Bombay).
Instead, they wanted Rashbehari Ghosh as the president and
sought to drop the resolutions on swadeshi, boycott and
national education. Both sides adopted rigid positions, leaving
no room for compromise. The split became inevitable, and
the Congress was now dominated by the Moderates who lost
no time in reiterating Congress’ commitment to the goal of
self-government within the British Empire and to the use of
constitutional methods only to achieve this goal.

Government Repression

The government launched a massive attack on the Extremists.
Between 1907 and 1911, five new laws were brought into
force to check anti-government activity. These legislations

”…the mischief of the trial and condemnation of Tilak would be
greater than if you left him alone”.
—John Morley, Secretary of State for India in
a letter to Sydenham, Governor of Bombay

included the Seditious Meetings Act, 1907; Indian Newspapers
(Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908; Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1908; and the Indian Press Act, 1910. Tilak, the main
Extremist leader, was tried in 1909 for sedition for what he
had written in 1908 in his Kesari about a bomb thrown by
Bengal revolutionaries in Muzaffarpur, resulting in the death
of two innocent European women.
Tilak had written: “This, no doubt, will inspire many
with hatred against the people belonging to the party of
rebels. It is not possible to cause British rule to disappear
from this country by such monstrous deeds. But rulers who
exercise unrestricted power must always remember that there
is also a limit to the patience of humanity … many newspapers
had warned the government that if they resorted to Russian
methods, then Indians too will be compelled to imitate the
Russian methods”.
In another article, Tilak wrote that the real means of
stopping the bombs consisted in making a beginning towards
the grant of rights of ‘Swarajya’ to the people. Tilak was
judged guilty and sentenced to six years’ transportation and
a fine of Rs 1,000. He was sent to Mandalay (Burma) jail
for six years. Aurobindo and B.C. Pal retired from active
politics. Lajpat Rai left for abroad. The Extremists were not
able to organise an effective alternative party to sustain the
movement. The Moderates were left with no popular base
or support, especially as the youth rallied behind the
Extremists.
After 1908, the national movement as a whole declined
for a time. In 1914, Tilak was released and he picked up the
threads of the movement.

The Government Strategy
The British government in India had been hostile to the
Congress from the beginning. Even after the Moderates, who

276  

dominated the Congress from the beginning, began distancing
themselves from the militant nationalist trend which had
become visible during the last decade of the nineteenth
century itself, government hostility did not stop. This was
because, in the government’s view, the Moderates still
represented an anti-imperialist force consisting of basically
patriotic and liberal intellectuals..
With the coming of Swadeshi and Boycott Movement
and the emergence of militant nationalist trend in a big way,
the government modified its strategy towards the nationalists.
Now, the policy was to be of ‘rallying them’ (John Morley—
the secretary of state) or the policy of ‘carrot and stick’.
It may be described as a three-pronged approach of repressionconciliation-suppression. In the first stage, the Extremists
were to be repressed mildly, mainly to frighten the Moderates.
In the second stage, the Moderates were to be placated
through some concessions, and hints were to be dropped that
more reforms would be forthcoming if the distance from the
Extremists was maintained. This was aimed at isolating the
Extremists: With the Moderates on its side, the government
could suppress the Extremists with its full might; the
Moderates could then be ignored.
Unfortunately, neither the Moderates nor the Extremists
understood the purpose behind the strategy. The Surat split
suggested that the policy of carrot and stick had brought rich
dividends to the British India government.

Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909
In October 1906, a group of Muslim elites called the Simla
Deputation, led by the Agha Khan, met Lord Minto and
demanded separate electorates for the Muslims and
representation in excess of their numerical strength in view
of ‘the value of the contribution’ Muslims were making “to
the defence of the empire”. The same group quickly took
over the Muslim League, initially floated by Nawab Salimullah
of Dacca along with Nawabs Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Waqar-ulMulk in December 1906. The Muslim League intended to
preach loyalty to the empire and to keep the Muslim
intelligentsia away from the Congress.

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  277

Gopal Krishna Gokhale also went to England to meet
the Secretary of State for India, John Morley, to put Congress
demands of self-governing system similar to that in the other
British colonies.

The Reforms

The viceroy, Lord Minto, and the Secretary of State for India,
John Morley, agreed that some reforms were due so as to
placate the Moderates as well as the Muslims. They worked
out a set of measures that came to be known as the MorleyMinto (or Minto-Morley) Reforms that translated into the
Indian Councils Act of 1909.
● The elective principle was recognised for the nonofficial membership of the councils in India. Indians were
allowed to participate in the election of various legislative
councils, though on the basis of class and community.
● For the first time, separate electorates for Muslims
for election to the central council was established—a most
detrimental step for India.
● The number of elected members in the Imperial
Legislative Council and the Provincial Legislative Councils
was increased. In the provincial councils, non-official majority
was introduced, but since some of these non-officials were
nominated and not elected, the overall non-elected majority
remained.
● According to Sumit Sarkar, in the Imperial Legislative
Council, of the total 69 members, 37 were to be the officials
and of the 32 non-officials, 5 were to be nominated. Of the
27 elected non-officials, 8 seats were reserved for the
Muslims under separate electorates (only Muslims could
vote here for the Muslim candidates), while 4 seats were
reserved for the British capitalists, 2 for the landlords and
13 seats came under general electorate.
● The elected members were to be indirectly elected.
The local bodies were to elect an electoral college, which
in turn would elect members of provincial legislatures, who
in turn would elect members of the central legislature.
● Besides separate electorates for the Muslims,
representation in excess of the strength of their population
was accorded to the Muslims. Also, the income qualification
for Muslim voters was kept lower than that for Hindus.

Reforms may not save the Raj, but if they don’t, nothing else
will.
Lord Morley
The reforms of 1909 afforded no answer, and could afford no
answer to Indian problems.
Montford Report
Political barrier was created round them, isolating them from the
rest of India and reversing the unifying and amalgamating process
which had been going on for centuries... The barrier was a small
one at first, for the electorates were very limited, but with every
extension of franchise it grew and affected the whole structure
of political and social life like some canker which corrupted the
entire system.
Jawaharlal Nehru
● Powers of legislatures—both at the centre and in
provinces—were enlarged and the legislatures could now pass
resolutions (which may or may not be accepted), ask
questions and supplementaries, vote separate items in the
budget though the budget as a whole could not be voted upon.
● One Indian was to be appointed to the viceroy’s
executive council (Satyendra Sinha was the first Indian to be
appointed in 1909).

Evaluation

The reforms of 1909 afforded no answer to the Indian
political problem. Lord Morley made it clear that colonial
self-government (as demanded by the Congress) was not
suitable for India, and he was against the introduction of
parliamentary or responsible government in India. He said,
“If it could be said that this chapter of reforms led directly
or indirectly to the establishment of a parliamentary system
in India, I, for one, would have nothing at all to do with it.”
The ‘constitutional’ reforms were, in fact, aimed at
dividing the nationalist ranks by confusing the Moderates and
at checking the growth of unity among Indians through the
obnoxious instrument of separate electorates. The government
aimed at rallying the Moderates and the Muslims against the
rising tide of nationalism. The officials and the Muslim
leaders often talked of the entire community when they talked

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  279

of the separate electorates, but in reality it meant the
appeasement of just a small section of the Muslim elite.
Besides, the system of election was too indirect and
it gave the impression of “infiltration of legislators through
a number of sieves”. And, while parliamentary forms were
introduced, no responsibility was conceded, which sometimes
led to thoughtless and irresponsible criticism of the
government. Only some members like Gokhale put to
constructive use the opportunity to debate in the councils
by demanding universal primary education, attacking repressive
policies and drawing attention to the plight of indentured
labour and Indian workers in South Africa.
What the reforms of 1909 gave to the people of the
country was a shadow rather than substance. The people had
demanded self-government but what they were given was
‘benevolent despotism’.
Summary
●

Why Militant Nationalism Grew
1. Realisation that the true nature of British rule was
exploitative, and that the British India government, instead
of conceding more, was taking away even what existed.
2. Growth of self-confidence and self-respect.
3. Impact of growth of education—increase in awareness and
unemployment.
4. International influences and events which demolished the
myth of white/European supremacy. These included
— emergence of Japan—an Asian country—as an industrial
power
— Abyssinia’s (Ethiopia) victory over Italy.
— Boer Wars (1899-1902) in which the British faced reverses.
— Japan’s victory over Russia (1905).
— nationalist movements worldwide.
5. Reaction to increasing westernisation.
6. Dissatisfaction with the achievements as well as the
methods of the Moderates.
7. Reactionary policies of Curzon such as the Calcutta
Corporation Act (1899), the Official Secrets Act (1904),
the Indian Universities Act (1904) and partition of Bengal
(1905).

280  
8. Existence of a militant school of thought.
9. Emergence of a trained leadership.

The Extremist Ideology
(i) Hatred for foreign rule
(ii) Belief in the capacity of the masses
(iii) Swarajya as goal
(iv) Advocacy of direct political action and self-sacrifice.

●

The Swadeshi and Boycott Movement
* Began as a reaction to partition of Bengal which became
known in 1903, was formally announced in July 1905 and
came into force in October 1905. The motive behind partition
was to weaken Bengal which was the nerve centre of Indian
nationalist activity; the official reason given for the partition
was that Bengal had become too big to administer—which
was true to some extent.
* Moderate-led anti-partition movement (1903-05) was under
Surendranath Banerjea, K.K. Mitra, Prithwishchandra Ray.
Methods included public meetings, petitions, memoranda,
propaganda through newspapers and pamphlets.
* The movement under Extremists (1905-08) was led by Tilak,
Bipin Chandra Pal, Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghosh.
Methods included boycott of foreign cloth and other goods,
public meetings and processions, forming corps of volunteers
or samitis, use of traditional popular festivals and melas for
propaganda, emphasis on self-reliance or atma shakti, launching
programme of swadeshi or national education, swadeshi or
indigenous enterprises, initiating new trends in Indian painting,
songs, poetry, pioneering research in science and later calling
for boycott of schools, colleges, councils, government service,
etc.
* Extremists took over because of the failure of the Moderates
to achieve positive results, divisive tactics of governments
of both Bengals, severe government repression.
* Extent of mass participation—students, women, certain
sections of zamindari, labour, some lower middle and middle
classes in towns and cities participated for the first time while
the Muslims generally kept away.
* Annulment of Partition mainly to curb the ‘menace’ of
revolutionary terrorism.
* Why Swadeshi Movement fizzled out by 1908
Severe government repression.
Lack of effective organisation and a disciplined focus.

Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)  281
With arrest/deportation of all leaders, the movement left
leaderless.
Split in nationalist ranks.
Narrow social base.
* Achievements
“A leap forward” because hitherto untouched sections
participated, major trends of later movement emerged;
richness of the movement extended to culture, science and
literature; people educated in bolder form of politics; colonial
hegemony undermined.
● Major Cause of Moderate-Extremist Split at Surat (1907)

Moderates wanted to restrict the Boycott Movement to Bengal
and to a boycott of foreign cloth and liquor.
Extremists wanted to take the movement to all parts of the
country and include within its ambit all forms of association
with the government through a boycott of schools, colleges,
law courts, legislative councils, government service, municipalities,
etc.

Morley-Minto Reforms

supplementaries, vote separate items of the budget.
One Indian to be on viceroy’s executive council.
Aimed at dividing the nationalist ranks and at rallying the
Moderates and the Muslims to the government’s side.
No responsibility entrusted to legislators—this resulted in
thought-less criticism sometimes.
System of election was too indirect.

First Phase of
Revolutionary Activities
(1907-1917)
Why the Surge of Revolutionary
Activities
The activities of revolutionary heroism started as a byproduct of the growth of militant nationalism. The first phase
acquired a more activist form as a fallout of the Swadeshi
and Boycott Movement and continued till 1917. The second
phase started as a fallout of the Non-Cooperation Movement.
After the decline of the open movement, the younger
nationalists who had participated in the movement found it
impossible to leave off and disappear into the background.
They looked for avenues to give expression to their patriotic
energies, but were disillusioned by the failure of the leadership,
even the Extremists, to find new forms of struggle to bring
into practice the new militant trends. The Extremist leaders,
although they called upon the youth to make sacrifices, failed
to create an effective organisation or find new forms of
political work to tap these revolutionary energies. The youth,
finding all avenues of peaceful political protest closed to
them under government repression, thought that if nationalist
goals of independence were to be met, the British must be
expelled physically by force.
282

First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907-1917)  283

The Revolutionary Programme
The revolutionaries considered, but did not find it practical
at that stage to implement, the options of creating a violent
mass revolution throughout the country or of trying to subvert
the loyalties of the Army. Instead, they opted to follow in
the footsteps of Russian nihilists or the Irish nationalists.
This methodology involved individual heroic actions, such as
organising assassinations of unpopular officials and of traitors
and informers among the revolutionaries themselves;
conducting swadeshi dacoities to raise funds for revolutionary
activities; and (during the First World War) organising
military conspiracies with expectation of help from the
enemies of Britain.
The idea was to strike terror in the hearts of the rulers,
arouse people and remove the fear of authority from their
minds. The revolutionaries intended to inspire the people by
appealing to their patriotism, especially the idealistic youth
who would finally drive the British out.
The Extremist leaders failed to ideologically counter
the revolutionaries as they did not highlight the difference
between a revolution based on activity of the masses and one
based on individual violent activity, thus allowing the
individualistic violent activities to take root.

A Survey of Revolutionary
Activities
Following is a brief survey of revolutionary activities in
different parts of India and abroad before and during the First
World War.

Bengal

By the 1870s, Calcutta’s student community was honeycombed
with secret societies, but these were not very active. The first
revolutionary groups were organised in 1902 in Midnapore
(under Jnanendranath Basu) and in Calcutta (the Anushilan
Samiti founded by Promotha Mitter, and including Jatindranath
Banerjee, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and others.) But their
activities were limited to giving physical and moral training
to the members and remained insignificant till 1907-08.

284  

In April 1906, an inner circle within Anushilan (Barindra
Kumar Ghosh, Bhupendranath Dutta) started the weekly
Yugantar and conducted a few abortive ‘actions’. By 190506, several newspapers had started advocating revolutionary
violence. For instance, after severe police brutalities on
participants of the Barisal Conference (April 1906), the
Yugantar wrote: “The remedy lies with the people. The 30
crore people inhabiting India must raise their 60 crore hands
to stop this curse of oppression. Force must be stopped by
force.”
Rashbehari Bose and Sachin Sanyal had organised a
secret society covering far-flung areas of Punjab, Delhi and
United Provinces while some others like Hemachandra
Kanungo went abroad for military and political training.
In 1907, an abortive attempt was made by the Yugantar
group on the life of a very unpopular British official, Sir
Fuller (the first Lt. Governor of the new province of Eastern
Bengal and Assam, although he had resigned from the post
on August 20, 1906).
In December 1907, there were attempts to derail the
train on which the lieutenant-governor, Sri Andrew Fraser,
was travelling
In 1908, Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose threw a
bomb at a carriage supposed to be carrying a particularly
sadistic white judge, Kingsford, in Muzaffarpur. Kingsford
was not in the carriage. Unfortunately, two British ladies,
instead, got killed. Prafulla Chaki shot himself dead while
Khudiram Bose was tried and hanged.
The whole Anushilan group was arrested including the
Ghosh brothers, Aurobindo and Barindra, who were tried in
the Alipore conspiracy case, variously called Manicktolla
bomb conspiracy or Muraripukur conspiracy. (Barindra
Ghosh’s house was on Muraripukur Road in the Manicktolla
suburb of Calcutta.) The Ghosh brothers were charged with
‘conspiracy’ or ‘waging war against the King’ – the equivalent
of high treason and punishable with death by hanging.
Chittaranjan Das defended Aurobindo. Aurobindo was acquitted
of all charges with the judge condemning the flimsy nature
of the evidence against him. Barindra Ghosh, as the head of
the secret society of revolutionaries and Ullaskar Dutt, as

First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907-1917)  285

the maker of bombs, were given the death penalty which was
later commuted to life in prison. During the trial, Narendra
Gosain (or Goswami), who had turned approver and Crown
witness, was shot dead by two co-accused, Satyendranath
Bose and Kanailal Dutta in jail.
In February 1909, the public prosecutor was shot dead
in Calcutta and in February 1910, a deputy superintendent
of police met the same fate while leaving the Calcutta High
Court. In 1908, Barrah dacoity was organised by Dacca
Anushilan under Pulin Das to raise funds for revolutionary
activities. Rashbehari Bose and Sachin Sanyal staged a
spectacular bomb attack on Viceroy Hardinge while he was
making his official entry into the new capital of Delhi in
a procession through Chandni Chowk in December 1912.
(Hardinge was injured, but not killed.)
Investigations following the assassination attempt led
to the Delhi Conspiracy trial. At the end of the trial, Basant
Kumar Biswas, Amir Chand and Avadh Behari were convicted
and executed for their roles in the conspiracy. Rashbehari
Bose was known as the person behind the plan but he evaded
arrest because, it is said, he escaped donning a disguise.
The western Anushilan Samiti found a good leader in
Jatindranath Mukherjee or Bagha Jatin and emerged as the
Jugantar (or Yugantar). Jatin revitalised links between the
central organisation in Calcutta and other places in Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa.
During the First World War, the Jugantar party arranged
to import German arms and ammunition through sympathisers
and revolutionaries abroad. Jatin asked Rashbehari Bose to
take charge of Upper India, aiming to bring about an all-India
insurrection in what has come to be called the ‘German Plot’
or the ‘Zimmerman Plan’. The Jugantar party raised funds
through a series of dacoities which came to be known as
taxicab dacoities and boat dacoities, so as to work out the
Indo-German conspiracy. It was planned that a guerrilla force
would be organised to start an uprising in the country, with
a seizure of Fort William and a mutiny by armed forces.
Unfortunately for the revolutionaries, the plot was leaked out
by a traitor. Police came to know that Bagha Jatin was in
Balasore waiting for the delivery of German arms. Jatin and

286  

his associates were located by the police. There was a gunfight as a result of which the revolutionaries were either
killed or arrested. The German plot thus failed. Jatin Mukherjee
was shot and died a hero’s death in Balasore on the Orissa
coast in September 1915.
“We shall die to awaken the nation”, was the call of
Bagha Jatin.
The newspapers and journals advocating revolutionary
activity included Sandhya and Yugantar in Bengal, and Kal
in Maharashtra.
In the end, revolutionary activity emerged as the most
substantial legacy of swadeshi Bengal which had an impact
on educated youth for a generation or more. But, an
overemphasis on Hindu religion kept the Muslims aloof.
Moreover, it encouraged quixotic heroism. No involvement
of the masses was envisaged, which, coupled with the narrow
upper caste social base of the movement in Bengal, severely
limited the scope of the revolutionary activity. In the end,
it failed to withstand the weight of State repression.

Maharashtra

The first of the revolutionary activities in Maharashtra was
the organisation of the Ramosi Peasant Force by Vasudev
Balwant Phadke in 1879, which aimed to rid the country of
the British by instigating an armed revolt by disrupting
communication lines. It hoped to raise funds for its activities
through dacoities. It was suppressed prematurely.
During the 1890s, Tilak propagated a spirit of militant
nationalism, including use of violence, through Ganapati and
Shivaji festivals and his journals Kesari and Maharatta. Two
of his disciples—the Chapekar brothers, Damodar and
Balkrishna—murdered the Plague Commissioner of Poona,
Rand, and one Lt. Ayerst in 1897.
Savarkar and his brother organised Mitra Mela, a
secret society, in 1899 which merged with Abhinav Bharat
(after Mazzinni’s ‘Young Italy’) in 1904. Soon Nasik, Poona
and Bombay emerged as centres of bomb manufacture. In
1909, A.M.T. Jackson, the Collector of Nasik, who was also
a well-known indologist, was killed by Anant Lakshman
Kanhere, a member of Abhinav Bharat.

First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907-1917)  287

It was found that the killing was part of a conspiracy
to overthrow the British government in India by means of
armed revolution. Thirty-eight people were arrested. Among
these, it was found that Savarkar (with his two brothers,) was
the brain, leader, and moving spirit of the conspiracy. At the
trial, Savarkar as the soul, inspiration, and moving spirit of
the conspiracy extending over a number of years, was
sentenced to transportation for life and forfeiture of all his
property.

Punjab
The Punjab extremism was fuelled by issues such as frequent
famines coupled with rise in land revenue and irrigation tax,
practice of ‘begar’ by zamindars and by the events in Bengal.
Among those active here were Lala Lajpat Rai who brought
out Punjabee (with its motto of self-help at any cost) and
Ajit Singh (Bhagat Singh’s uncle) who organised the extremist
Anjuman-i-Mohisban-i-Watan in Lahore with its journal,
Bharat Mata. Before Ajit Singh’s group turned to extremism,
it was active in urging non-payment of revenue and water rates
among Chenab colonists and Bari Doab peasants. Other
leaders included Aga Haidar, Syed Haider Raza, Bhai
Parmanand and the radical Urdu poet, Lalchand ‘Falak’.
Extremism in the Punjab died down quickly after the
government struck in May 1907 with a ban on political
meetings and the deportation of Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh.
After this, Ajit Singh and a few other associates—Sufi
Ambaprasad, Lalchand, Bhai Parmanand, Lala Hardayal—
developed into full-scale revolutionaries.
During the First World War, Rashbehari Bose was
involved as one of the leading figures of the Ghadr Revolution.
At the close of 1913, Bose met Jatin to discuss the
possibilities of an all-India armed rising of 1857 type. Then,
he worked in cooperation with Bagha Jatin, extending the
Bengal plan to Punjab and the upper provinces. As the plan
for revolution did not succeed, Rashbehari Bose escaped to
Japan in 1915. Much later, he was to play an important part
in the founding of the Indian National Army.

Revolutionary Activities Abroad

The need for shelter, the possibility of bringing out
revolutionary literature that would be immune from the Press

288  

Acts and the quest for arms took Indian revolutionaries
abroad.
Shyamji Krishnavarma had started in London in 1905
an Indian Home Rule Society—‘India House’—as a centre
for Indian students, a scholarship scheme to bring radical
youth from India, and a journal The Indian Sociologist.
Revolutionaries such as Savarkar and Hardayal became the
members of India House.
Madanlal Dhingra from this circle assassinated the India
office bureaucrat Curzon-Wyllie in 1909. Soon, London
became too dangerous for the revolutionaries, particularly
after Savarkar had been extradited in 1910 and transported
for life in the Nasik conspiracy case.
New centres emerged on the continent—Paris and
Geneva—from where Madam Bhikaji Cama, a Parsi
revolutionary who had developed contacts with French
socialists and who brought out Bande Mataram, and Ajit
Singh operated. And after 1909 when Anglo-German relations
deteriorated, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya chose Berlin as
his base.
The Ghadr
The Ghadr Party was a revolutionary group organised around
a weekly newspaper The Ghadr with its headquarters at San
Views
The ultimate object of the revolutionaries is not terrorism but
revolution and the purpose of the revolution is to install a national
government.
Subhash Chandra Bose
Will you not see the writing that these terrorists are writing with
their blood?
M.K. Gandhi
Neither rich nor able, a poor son like myself can offer nothing
but his blood on the altar of mother’s deliverance... may I be
reborn of the same mother and may I redie in the same sacred
cause, till my mission is done and she stands free for the good
of humanity and to the glory of God.
Madanlal Dhingra
God has not conferred upon the foreigners the grant inscribed
on a copper plate of the kingdom of Hindustan... Do not
circumscribe your vision like a frog in a well; get out of the
Penal Code and enter the extremely high atmosphere of the
Srimat Bhagvad Gita and consider the actions of great men.

First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907-1917)  289

Francisco and branches along the US coast and in the Far
East.
These revolutionaries included mainly ex-soldiers and
peasants who had migrated from the Punjab to the USA and
Canada in search of better employment opportunities. They
were based in the US and Canadian cities along the western
(Pacific) coast. Pre-Ghadr revolutionary activity had been
carried on by Ramdas Puri, G.D. Kumar, Taraknath Das,
Sohan Singh Bhakna and Lala Hardayal who reached there in
1911. To carry out revolutionary activities, the earlier
activists had set up a ‘Swadesh Sevak Home’ at Vancouver
and ‘United India House’ at Seattle. Finally in 1913, the
Ghadr was established.
The Ghadr programme was to organise assassinations
of officials, publish revolutionary and anti-imperialist
literature, work among Indian troops stationed abroad, procure
arms and bring about a simultaneous revolt in all British
colonies.
The moving spirits behind the Ghadr Party were Lala
Hardayal, Ramchandra, Bhagwan Singh, Kartar Singh Saraba,
Barkatullah, and Bhai Parmanand. The Ghadrites intended to
bring about a revolt in India. Their plans were encouraged
by two events in 1914—the Komagata Maru incident and
the outbreak of the First World War.
Komagata Maru Incident and the Ghadr The
importance of this event lies in the fact that it created an
explosive situation in the Punjab. Komagata Maru was the
name of a ship which was carrying 370 passengers, mainly
Sikh and Punjabi Muslim would-be immigrants, from Singapore
to Vancouver. They were turned back by Canadian authorities
after two months of privation and uncertainty. It was generally
believed that the Canadian authorities were influenced by the
British government. The ship finally anchored at Calcutta in
September 1914. The inmates refused to board the Punjabbound train. In the ensuing conflict with the police at Budge
Budge near Calcutta, 22 persons died.
Inflamed by this and with the outbreak of the First
World War, the Ghadr leaders decided to launch a violent
attack to oust British rule in India. They urged fighters to
go to India. Kartar Singh Saraba and Raghubar Dayal Gupta

290  

left for India. Bengal revolutionaries were contacted;
Rashbehari Bose and Sachin Sanyal were asked to lead the
movement. Political dacoities were committed to raise funds.
The Punjab political dacoities of January-February 1915 had
a somewhat new social content. In at least 3 out of the 5
main cases, the raiders targeted the moneylenders and the
debt records before decamping with the cash. Thus, an
explosive situation was created in Punjab.
The Ghadrites fixed February 21, 1915 as the date for
an armed revolt in Ferozepur, Lahore and Rawalpindi garrisons.
The plan was foiled at the last moment due to treachery. The
authorities took immediate action, aided by the Defence of
India Rules, 1915. Rebellious regiments were disbanded,
leaders arrested and deported and 45 of them hanged.
Rashbehari Bose fled to Japan (from where he and Abani
Mukherji made many efforts to send arms) while Sachin
Sanyal was transported for life.
The British met the wartime threat with a formidable
battery of repressive measures—the most intensive since
1857—and above all by the Defence of India Act passed in
March 1915 primarily to smash the Ghadr movement. There
were large-scale detentions without trial, special courts
giving extremely severe sentences, numerous court-martials
of armymen. Apart from the Bengal revolutionaries and the
Punjab Ghadrites, radical pan-Islamists—Ali brothers, Maulana
Azad, Hasrat Mohani—were interned for years.
Evaluation of Ghadr The achievement of the Ghadr
movement lay in the realm of ideology. It preached militant
nationalism with a completely secular approach. But politically
and militarily, it failed to achieve much because it lacked
an organised and sustained leadership, underestimated the
extent of preparation required at every level—organisational,
ideological, financial and tactical strategic—and perhaps Lala
Hardayal was unsuited for the job of an organiser.
Revolutionaries in Europe
The Berlin Committee for Indian Independence was
established in 1915 by Virendranath Chattopadhyay,
Bhupendranath Dutta, Lala Hardayal and others with the help
of the German foreign office under ‘Zimmerman Plan’. These

First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907-1917)  291

revolutionaries aimed to mobilise the Indian settlers abroad
to send volunteers and arms to India to incite rebellion among
Indian troops there and to even organise an armed invasion
of British India to liberate the country.
The Indian revolutionaries in Europe sent missions to
Baghdad, Persia, Turkey and Kabul to work among Indian
troops and the Indian prisoners of war (POWs) and to incite
anti-British feelings among the people of these countries.
One mission under Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, Barkatullah
and Obaidullah Sindhi went to Kabul to organise a ‘provisional
Indian government’ there with the help of the crown prince,
Amanullah.
Mutiny in Singapore
Among the scattered mutinies during this period, the most
notable was in Singapore on February 15, 1915 by Punjabi
Muslim 5th Light Infantry and the 36th Sikh battalion under
Jamadar Chisti Khan, Jamadar Abdul Gani and Subedar Daud
Khan. It was crushed after a fierce battle in which many were
killed. Later, 37 persons were executed and 41 transported
for life.

Decline
There was a temporary respite in revolutionary activity after
the First World War because the release of prisoners held
under the Defence of India Rules cooled down passions a
bit; there was an atmosphere of conciliation after Montagu’s
August 1917 statement and the talk of constitutional reforms;
and the coming of Gandhi on the scene with the programme
of non-violent non-cooperation promised new hope.

First World War and
Nationalist Response
In the First World War (1914-1919), Britain allied with
France, Russia, USA, Italy and Japan against Germany,
Austria-Hungary and Turkey. This period saw the maturing
of Indian nationalism. The nationalist response to British
participation in the First World War was three-fold:
(i) the Moderates supported the empire in the war as
a matter of duty;
(ii) the Extremists, including Tilak (who was released
in June 1914), supported the war efforts in the
mistaken belief that Britain would repay India’s
loyalty with gratitude in the form of selfgovernment; and
(iii) the revolutionaries decided to utilise the
opportunity to wage a war on British rule and
liberate the country.
The Indian supporters of British war efforts failed to
see that the imperialist powers were fighting to safeguard
their own colonies and markets.
The revolutionary activity was carried out through the
Ghadr Party in North America, Berlin Committee in Europe
and some scattered mutinies by Indian soldiers, such as the
one in Singapore. In India, for revolutionaries striving for
immediate complete independence, the War seemed a heaven294

First World War and Nationalist Response  295

sent opportunity, draining India of troops (the number of
white soldiers went down at one point to only 15,000), and
raising the possibility of financial and military help from
Germany and Turkey—the enemies of Britain. (Details of
revolutionary activities of this period have been covered in
the previous chapter.)

Home Rule League Movement
The Home Rule Movement was the Indian response to the
First World War in a less charged but a more effective way
than the response of Indians living abroad which took the
form of the romantic Ghadr adventure.
Prominent leaders—Balgangadhar Tilak, Annie Besant,
G.S. Khaparde, Sir S. Subramania Iyer, Joseph Baptista and
Mohammad Ali Jinnah among others—got together and
decided that it was necessary to have a national alliance that
would work throughout the year (unlike the Congress which
had annual sessions) with the main objective of demanding
self-government or home rule for all of India within the
British commonwealth. This alliance was to be the All India
Home Rule League along the lines of the Irish Home Rule
League.
In the end, however, two Home Rule Leagues were
launched—one by Balgangadhar Tilak and the other by Annie
Besant, both with the aim of beginning a new trend of
aggressive politics.

Factors Leading to the Movement

Some of the factors leading to the formation of the Home
Rule Movement were as follows.
(i) A section of the nationalists felt that popular
pressure was required to attain concessions from the
government.
(ii) The Moderates were disillusioned with the MorleyMinto reforms.
(iii) People were feeling the burden of wartime miseries
caused by high taxation and a rise in prices, and were ready
to participate in any aggressive movement of protest.
(iv) The war, being fought among the major imperialist
powers of the day and backed by naked propaganda against
each other, exposed the myth of white superiority.

296  

(v) Tilak was ready to assume leadership after his
release in June 1914, and had made conciliatory gestures—
to the government reassuring it of his loyalty and to the
Moderates that he wanted, like the Irish Home Rulers, a
reform of the administration and not an overthrow of the
government. He also admitted that the acts of violence had
only served to retard the pace of political progress in India.
He urged all Indians to assist the British government in its
hour of crisis.
(vi) Annie Besant, the Irish theosophist based in India
since 1896, had decided to enlarge the sphere of her
activities to include the building of a movement for home
rule on the lines of the Irish Home Rule Leagues.

The Leagues

Both Tilak and Besant realised that the sanction of a
Moderate-dominated Congress as well as full cooperation of
the Extremists was essential for the movement to succeed.
Having failed at the 1914 session of the Congress to reach
a Moderate-Extremist rapprochement, Tilak and Besant
decided to revive political activity on their own.
By early 1915, Annie Besant had launched a campaign
to demand self-government for India after the war on the lines
of white colonies. She campaigned through her newspapers,
New India and Commonweal, and through public meetings
and conferences. At the annual session of the Congress in
1915, the efforts of Tilak and Besant met with some success.
It was decided that the Extremists be admitted to the
Congress. Although Besant failed to get the Congress to
approve her scheme of Home Rule Leagues, the Congress
did commit itself to a programme of educative propaganda
and to a revival of local-level Congress committees. Not
willing to wait for too long, Besant laid the condition that
if the Congress did not implement its commitments, she
would be free to set up her own league—which she finally
had to, as there was no response from the Congress.
Tilak and Besant set up their separate leagues to avoid
any friction. As Annie Besant said, some supporters of Tilak
were not at ease with her and similarly, some of her own
supporters were not at ease with Tilak. However, both leagues
coordinated their efforts by confining their work to their
specific areas. They cooperated where they could.

First World War and Nationalist Response  297

Tilak’s League
Tilak set up his Indian Home Rule League in April 1916.
Tilak held his first Home Rule meeting at Belgaum. Poona
was the headquarters of his league. His league was restricted
to Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, Central
Provinces and Berar. It had six branches and the demands
included swarajya, formation of linguistic states and education
in the vernacular.
Besant’s League
Annie Besant set up her All-India Home Rule League in
September 1916 in Madras (now Chennai) and covered the
rest of India (including Bombay city). It had 200 branches,
was loosely organised as compared to Tilak’s league and had
George Arundale as the organising secretary. Besides Arundale,
the main work was done by B.W. Wadia and C.P. Ramaswamy
Aiyar.

The Home Rule League Programme

The League campaign aimed to convey to the common man
the message of home rule as self-government. It carried a
much wider appeal than the earlier mobilisations had and also
attracted the hitherto ‘politically backward’ regions of Gujarat
and Sindh. The aim was to be achieved by promoting political
education and discussion through public meetings, organising
libraries and reading rooms containing books on national
politics, holding conferences, organising classes for students
on politics, carrying out propaganda through newspapers,
pamphlets, posters, illustrated post-cards, plays, religious
songs, etc., collecting funds, organising social work, and
participating in local government activities. The Russian
Revolution of 1917 proved to be an added advantage for the
Home Rule campaign.
The Home Rule agitation was later joined by Motilal
Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Chittaranjan Das,
K.M. Munshi, B. Chakravarti, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Madan
Mohan Malaviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Tej Bahadur Sapru
and Lala Lajpat Rai. Some of these leaders became heads
of local branches of Annie Besant’s League. Mohammad Ali
Jinnah led the Bombay division. Many of the Moderate
Congressmen who were disillusioned with Congress inactivity,
and some members of Gokhale’s Servants of India Society

298  

also joined the agitation. However, Anglo-Indians, most of
the Muslims and non-brahmins from the South did not join
as they felt Home Rule would mean rule of the Hindu
majority, and that too mainly by the high caste.

Government Attitude

The government came down with severe repression, especially
in Madras where the students were prohibited from attending
political meetings. A case was instituted against Tilak which
was, however, rescinded by the high court. Tilak was barred
from entering the Punjab and Delhi. In June 1917, Annie
Besant and her associates, B.P. Wadia and George Arundale,
were arrested. This invited nationwide protest. In a dramatic
gesture, Sir S. Subramaniya Aiyar renounced his knighthood
while Tilak advocated a programme of passive resistance. The
repression only served to harden the attitude of the agitators
and strengthen their resolve to resist the government. Montagu,
the Secretary of State for India, commented that “Shiva ...cut
his wife into fifty-two pieces only to discover that he had
fifty-two wives. This is what happens to the Government of
India when it interns Mrs Besant.” Annie Besant was released
in September 1917.

Why the Agitation Faded Out by 1919

The Home Rule agitation proved to be short-lived. By 1919,
it had petered out. The reasons for the decline were as
follows.
(i) There was a lack of effective organisation.
(ii) Communal riots were witnessed during 1917-18.
(iii) The Moderates who had joined the Congress after
Annie Besant’s arrest were pacified by talk of reforms
(contained in Montagu’s statement of August 1917 which
held self-government as the long-term goal of the British rule
in India) and Besant’s release.
(iv) Talk of passive resistance by the Extremists kept
the Moderates away from activity from September 1918
onwards.
(v) The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms which became
known in July 1918 further divided the nationalist ranks.
Annie Besant herself was in two minds about the use of the
league after the announcement of the reforms. Annie Besant

First World War and Nationalist Response  299

vacillated over her response to the reforms and the techniques
of passive resistance.
(vi) Tilak had to go abroad (September 1918) in
connection with a libel case against Valentine Chirol whose
book, Indian Unrest, had featured Tilak as responsible for
the agitational politics that had developed in India. With
Besant unable to give a positive lead and Tilak away in
England, the movement was left leaderless.
(vii) Gandhi’s fresh approach to the struggle for
freedom was slowly but surely catching the imagination of
the people, and the mass movement that was gathering
momentum pushed the home rule movement onto the side
lines till it petered out.
[In 1920, Gandhi accepted the presidentship of the All
India Home Rule League, and changed the organisation’s
name to Swarajya Sabha. Within a year, however, the league
joined the Indian National Congress.]

Positive Gains

The Home Rule Leagues and the associated activities had
some positive effects and contributed to the fresh direction
that the freedom struggle was to take in the coming years.
The Home Rule Movement marked a transition between the
deliberative and rather inactive nature of the Congress till
then and the Gandhian phase that was to come with its mass
involvement in the struggle for freedom.
(i) The movement shifted the emphasis from the
educated elite to the masses and permanently deflected the
movement from the course mapped by the Moderates.
(ii) It created an organisational link between the town
and the country, which was to prove crucial in later years
when the national movement entered its mass phase in a true
sense.
(iii) It created a generation of ardent nationalists.
(iv) It prepared the masses for politics of the Gandhian
style.
(v) The August 1917 declaration of Montagu and the
Montford reforms were influenced by the Home Rule
agitation.
(vi) The efforts of Tilak and Annie Besant towards the

300  

Moderate-Extremist reunion at Lucknow (1916) revived the
Congress as an effective instrument of Indian nationalism.
(vii) The home rule movement lent a new dimension
and a sense of urgency to the national movement.

Lucknow Session of the Indian
National Congress (1916)
Readmission of Extremists to Congress

The Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress,
presided over by a Moderate, Ambika Charan Majumdar,
finally readmitted the Extremists led by Tilak to the Congress
fold. Various factors facilitated this reunion:
(i) Old controversies had become meaningless now.
(ii) Both the Moderates and the Extremists realised that
the split had led to political inactivity.
(iii) Annie Besant and Tilak had made vigorous efforts
for the reunion. To allay Moderate suspicions, Tilak had
declared that he supported a reform of administration and
not an overthrow of the government. He also denounced acts
of violence.
(iv) The death of two Moderates, Gokhale and
Pherozshah Mehta, who had led the Moderate opposition
to the Extremists, facilitated the reunion.

Lucknow Pact between Congress and
Muslim League

Another significant development to take place at Lucknow
was the coming together of the Muslim League and the
Congress and the presentation of common demands by them
to the government. This happened at a time when the Muslim
League, now dominated by the younger militant nationalists,
was coming closer to the Congress objectives and turning
increasingly anti-imperialist.
Why the Change in the League’s Altitude
There were many reasons for the shift in the League’s
position:
(i) Britain’s refusal to help Turkey (ruled by the Khalifa
who claimed religio-political leadership of all Muslims) in

First World War and Nationalist Response  301

its wars in the Balkans (1912-13) and with Italy (during 1911)
had angered the Muslims.
(ii) Annulment of partition of Bengal in 1911 had
annoyed those sections of the Muslims who had supported
the partition.
(iii) The refusal of the British government in India to
set up a university at Aligarh with powers to affiliate colleges
all over India also alienated some Muslims.
(iv) The younger League members were turning to
bolder nationalist politics and were trying to outgrow the
limited political outlook of the Aligarh school. The Calcutta
session of the Muslim League (1912) had committed the
League to “working with other groups for a system of selfgovernment suited to India, provided it did not come in
conflict with its basic objective of protection of interests
of the Indian Muslims”. Thus, the goal of self-government
similar to that of the Congress brought both sides closer.
(v) Younger Muslims were infuriated by the government
repression during the First World War. Maulana Azad’s Al
Hilal and Mohammad Ali’s Comrade faced suppression while
the leaders such as Ali brothers, Maulana Azad and Hasrat
Mohani faced internment. This generated anti-imperialist
sentiments among the ‘Young Party’.
The Nature of the Pact
The Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the Muslim
League could be considered an important event in the course
of the nationalistic struggle for freedom.
While the League agreed to present joint constitutional
demands with the Congress to the government, the Congress
accepted the Muslim League’s position on separate electorates
which would continue till any one community demanded joint
electorates. The Muslims were also granted a fixed proportion

they fall.

the INC—1916)

302  

of seats in the legislatures at all-India and provincial levels.
The joint demands were—
● Government should declare that it would confer selfgovernment on Indians at an early date.
● The representative assemblies at the central as well
as provincial level should be further expanded with an elected
majority and more powers given to them.
● The term of the legislative council should be five
years.
● The salaries of the Secretary of State for India should
be paid by the British treasury and not drawn from Indian
funds.
● Half the members of the viceroy’s and provincial
governors’ executive councils should be Indians.
Critical Comments
Though half the executive was to be elected by the legislature,
the executive as a whole was not to be responsible to the
legislature. The legislature could not remove the elected half
of the executive, but since important matters like the budget
were dependent upon the approval of the legislature, a
constitutional deadlock was most likely. This was the nature
of executive-legislature relations that the Congress seemed
to ask for in any scheme of post-war constitutional reforms.
The Lucknow Pact demands were thus just a significantly
expanded version of the Morley-Minto reforms.
While the effort of the Congress and the Muslim
League to put up a united front was a far-sighted one, the
acceptance of the principle of separate electorates by the
Congress implied that the Congress and the League came
together as separate political entities. This was a major
landmark in the evolution of the two-nation theory by the
Muslim League. Secondly, while the leaders of the two
groups came together, efforts to bring together the masses
from the two communities were not considered. However,
the controversial decision to accept the principle of separate
electorates represented a serious desire on the part of the
Congress to allay minority fears of majority domination.
Moreover, there was a large amount of enthusiasm generated
among the people by this reunion. Even the government
decided to placate the nationalists by declaring its intention

First World War and Nationalist Response  303

to grant self-government to Indians in times to come, as
contained in Montagu’s August 1917 declaration.

Montagu’s Statement of August
1917
The Secretary of State for India, Edwin Samuel Montagu,
made a statement on August 20, 1917 in the British House
of Commons in what has come to be known as the August
Declaration of 1917. The statement said: “The government
policy is of an increasing participation of Indians in every
branch of administration and gradual development of selfgoverning institutions with a view to the progressive realisation
of responsible government in India as an integral part of the
British Empire.”
From now onwards, the demand by nationalists for selfgovernment or home rule could not be termed as seditious
since attainment of self-government for Indians now became
a government policy, unlike Morley’s statement in 1909 that
the reforms were not intended to give self-government to
India. Also, in the use of the term ‘responsible government’
was implied the condition that the rulers were to be
answerable to the elected representatives, and not only to the
imperial government in London. However, it was equally
clear that the British had no intention of handing over power
to predominantly elected legislatures with an Indian majority.
So, in order that the executive be made responsible in some
measure to the elected assemblies, whose size and the
proportion of elected members in which was going to be
increased in any case, the concept of ‘dyarchy’ was to be
evolved.

Indian Objections

The objections of the Indian leaders to Montagu’s statement
were two-fold—
(i) No specific time frame was given.
(ii) The government alone was to decide the nature and
the timing of advance towards a responsible government, and
the Indians were resentful that the British would decide what
was good and what was bad for Indians.

Emergence of Gandhi
Towards the end of the First World War, various forces were
at work in India and on the international scene. After the end
of the war, there was a resurgence of nationalist activity in
India and in many other colonies in Asia and Africa. The
Indian struggle against imperialism took a decisive turn
305

306  

towards a broad-based popular struggle with the emergence
of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on the Indian political
scene.

Why Nationalist Resurgence
Now
After the war, the conditions in India and influences from
abroad created a situation that was ready for a national
upsurge against foreign rule.

Post-War Economic Hardships

India contributed in men and money towards the British war
efforts. Thousands of Indian men died in the war on various
fronts. The food supplies and ammunition and the army’s keep
came from the money raised by taxing Indians. When the war
ended, all sections of the Indian population were experiencing
hardships on various fronts.
Industry First, an increase in prices, then a recession
coupled with increased foreign investment brought many
industries to the brink of closure and loss. They now
demanded protection against imports besides government
aid.
Workers and Artisans This section of the populace
faced unemployment and bore the brunt of high prices.
Peasantry Faced with high taxation and poverty, the
peasants waited for a lead to protest.
Soldiers Soldiers who returned from battlefields abroad
gave an idea of their experience to the rural folk. They were
also surprised to return to a country that was impoverished
and had less liberty than before.
Educated Urban Classes This section was facing
unemployment as well as suffering from an acute awareness
of racism in the attitude of the British.

Expectations of Political Gains for
Cooperation in the War

The contribution of Indians to the British war effort was huge,
though it has gone unacknowledged. Gandhi and most

Emergence of Gandhi

 307

nationalists extended cooperation to the war effort and a huge
number of Indian troops sacrificed their lives on the war
fronts. So, after the war, there were high expectations of
political gains from the British government and this too
contributed towards the charged atmosphere in the country.

Nationalist Disillusionment with
Imperialism Worldwide
The Allied powers, to rally the colonies to their side during
the war, had promised them an era of democracy and selfdetermination after the war. During the war, both sides to
the war had launched vicious propaganda to malign each other
and expose each other’s uncivilised colonial record. But soon
it became clear from the Paris Peace Conference and other
peace treaties that the imperialist powers had no intention
of loosening their hold over the colonies; in fact they went
on to divide the colonies of the vanquished powers among
themselves. All this served to further erode the myth of the
cultural and military superiority of the whites. As a result,
the post-war period saw a resurgence of militant nationalist
activity throughout Asia and Africa—in Turkey, Egypt,
Ireland, Iran, Afghanistan, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines,
Indonesia, Indo-China, China and Korea.

Impact of Russian Revolution
(November 7, 1917)
The Bolshevik Party of workers overthrew the Czarist regime
and founded the first socialist state, the Soviet Union, under
the leadership of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov or Lenin. The
Soviet Union unilaterally renounced the Czarist imperialist
rights in China and the rest of Asia, gave rights of selfdetermination to former Czarist colonies in Asia and gave
equal status to the Asian nationalities within its borders.
The October Revolution brought home the message that
immense power lay with the people, and that the masses were
capable of challenging the mightiest of tyrants provided they
were organised, united and determined.

308  

Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms
and Government of India Act,
1919
The British government, not prepared to part with or even
share its power with the Indians, once again resorted to the
policy of ‘carrot and stick’. The carrot was represented by
the insubstantial Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while
measures such as the Rowlatt Act represented the stick.
In line with the government policy contained in
Montagu’s statement of August 1917, the government
announced further constitutional reforms in July 1918,
known as Montagu-Chelmsford or Montford Reforms. Based
on these, the Government of India Act, 1919 was enacted.

Main Features

The main features of the Montford Reforms were as follows.
● Provincial Government—Introduction of
Dyarchy
The Act introduced dyarchy for the executive at the level of
the provincial government.
Executive (i) Dyarchy, i.e., rule of two—executive
councillors and popular ministers—was introduced. The
governor was to be the executive head in the province.
(ii) Subjects were divided into two lists: ‘reserved’
which included subjects such as law and order, finance, land
revenue, irrigation, etc., and ‘transferred’ subjects such as
education, health, local government, industry, agriculture,
excise, etc. The reserved subjects were to be administered
by the governor through his executive council of bureaucrats,
and the transferred subjects were to be administered by
ministers nominated from among the elected members of the
legislative council.
(iii) The ministers were to be responsible to the
legislature and had to resign if a no-confidence motion was
passed against them by the legislature, while the executive
councillors were not to be responsible to the legislature.
(iv) In case of failure of constitutional machinery in

Emergence of Gandhi

 309

the province the governor could take over the administration
of transferred subjects also.
(v) The secretary of state for India and the governorgeneral could interfere in respect of reserved subjects while
in respect of the transferred subjects, the scope for their
interference was restricted.
Legislature (i) Provincial legislative councils were
further expanded and 70 per cent of the members were to
be elected.
(ii) The system of communal and class electorates was
further consolidated.
(iii) Women were also given the right to vote.
(iv) The legislative councils could initiate legislation
but the governor’s assent was required. The governor could
veto bills and issue ordinances.
(v) The legislative councils could reject the budget but
the governor could restore it, if necessary.
(vi) The legislators enjoyed freedom of speech.
● Central Government—Still Without
Responsible Government
No responsible government was envisaged in the Act for the
government at the all-India level. The main points were:
Executive (i) The governor-general was to be the chief
executive authority.
(ii) There were to be two lists for administration—
central and provincial.
(iii) In the viceroy’s executive council of eight, three
were to be Indians.
(iv) The governor-general retained full control over the
reserved subjects in the provinces.
(v) The governor-general could restore cuts in grants,
certify bills rejected by the central legislature and issue
ordinances.
Legislature (i) A bicameral arrangement was introduced.
The lower house or Central Legislative Assembly would
consist of 145 members (41 nominated and 104 elected—
52 General, 30 Muslims, 2 Sikhs, 20 Special) and the upper
house or Council of State would have 60 members, of which
26 were to be nominated and 34 elected—20 General, 10

310  

Muslims, 3 Europeans and 1 Sikh (as per the figures given
by Subhash Kashyap).
(ii) The Council of State had a tenure of 5 years and
had only male members, while the Central Legislative
Assembly had a tenure of 3 years.
(iii) The legislators could ask questions and
supplementaries, pass adjournment motions and vote a part
of the budget, but 75 per cent of the budget was still not
votable.
Some Indians found their way into important committees
including finance.
● On the home government (in Britain) front, the
Government of India Act, 1919 made an important change—
the Secretary of State for India was henceforth to be paid
out of the British exchequer.

Drawbacks
The reforms had many drawbacks—
(i) Franchise was very limited. The electorate was
extended to some one-and-a-half million for the central
legislature, while the population of India was around 260
million, as per one estimate.
(ii) At the centre, the legislature had no control over
the viceroy and his executive council.
(iii) Division of subjects was not satisfactory at the
centre.
(iv) Allocation of seats for central legislature to the
provinces was based on ‘importance’ of provinces—for
instance, Punjab’s military importance and Bombay’s
commercial importance.
(v) At the level of provinces, division of subjects and
parallel administration of two parts was irrational and, hence,
unworkable. Subjects like irrigation, finance, police, press
and justice were ‘reserved’.
(vi) The provincial ministers had no control over
finances and over the bureaucrats; this would lead to constant
friction between the two. Ministers were often not consulted
on important matters too; in fact, they could be overruled

special.

Congress’s Reaction
The Congress met in a special session in August 1918 at
Bombay under Hasan Imam’s presidency and declared the
reforms to be “disappointing” and “unsatisfactory” and
demanded effective self-government instead.
The Montford reforms were termed “unworthy and
disappointing—a sunless dawn” by Tilak, even as Annie
Besant found them “unworthy of England to offer and India
to accept”.

Making of Gandhi
Early Career and Experiments with
Truth in South Africa

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869
in Porbandar in the princely state of Kathiawar in Gujarat.
His father was a diwan (minister) of the state. Having studied
law in England, Gandhi, in 1898, went to South Africa in
connection with a case involving his client, Dada Abdullah.
In South Africa he witnessed the ugly face of white racism
and the humiliation and contempt to which Asians, who had
gone to South Africa as labourers, were subjected. He
decided to stay in South Africa to organise the Indian workers
to enable them to fight for their rights. He stayed there till
1914 after which he returned to India.
The Indians in South Africa consisted of three
categories—one, the indentured Indian labour, mainly from
south India, who had migrated to South Africa after 1890
to work on sugar plantations; two, the merchants—mostly
Meman Muslims who had followed the labourers; and three,
the ex-indentured labourers who had settled down with their
children in South Africa after the expiry of their contracts.
These Indians were mostly illiterate and had little or no
knowledge of English. They accepted racial discrimination
as a part of their daily existence. These Indian immigrants
had to suffer many disabilities. They were denied the right
to vote. They could reside only in prescribed locations which
were insanitary and congested. In some colonies, Asians and
Africans could not stay out of doors after 9 PM nor could
they use public footpaths.
Moderate Phase of Struggle (1894-1906)
During this phase, Gandhi relied on sending petitions and
memorials to the authorities in South Africa and in Britain
hoping that once the authorities were informed of the plight
of Indians, they would take sincere steps to redress their
grievances as the Indians were, after all, British subjects. To
unite different sections of Indians, he set up the Natal Indian
Congress and started a paper Indian Opinion.

Phase of Passive Resistance or Satyagraha
(1906-1914)
The second phase, which began in 1906, was characterised
by the use of the method of passive resistance or civil
disobedience, which Gandhi named satyagraha.
Satyagraha against Registration Certificates (1906)
A new legislation in South Africa made it compulsory for
Indians there to carry at all times certificates of registration
with their fingerprints. The Indians under Gandhi’s leadership
decided not to submit to this discriminatory measure. Gandhi
formed the Passive Resistance Association to conduct the
campaign of defying the law and suffering all the penalties
resulting from such a defiance. Thus was born satyagraha
or devotion to truth, the technique of resisting adversaries
without violence. The government jailed Gandhi and others
who refused to register themselves. Later, the authorities
used deceit to make these defiant Indians register themselves.
The Indians under the leadership of Gandhi retaliated by
publicly burning their registration certificates. All this showed
up the South African government in a bad light. In the end,
there was a compromise settlement.
Campaign against Restrictions on Indian Migration
The earlier campaign was widened to include protest against
a new legislation imposing restrictions on Indian migration.
The Indians defied this law by crossing over from one
province to another and by refusing to produce licences.
Many of these Indians were jailed.
Campaign against Poll Tax and Invalidation of
Indian Marriages A poll tax of three pounds was imposed
on all ex-indentured Indians. The demand for the abolition
of poll tax (which was too much for the poor ex-indentured
Indians who earned less than ten shillings a month) widened
the base of the campaign. Then a Supreme Court order which
invalidated all marriages not conducted according to Christian
rites and registered by the registrar of marriages drew the
anger of the Indians and others who were not Christians. By
implication, Hindu, Muslim and Parsi marriages were illegal
and children born out of such marriages, illegitimate. The
Indians treated this judgement as an insult to the honour of

314  

Tolstoy Farm
As it became rather difficult to sustain the high pitch of the struggle,
Gandhi decided to devote all his attention to the struggle.
The Tolstoy Farm was founded in 1910 and named as such
by Gandhi’s associate, Herman Kallenbach, after the Russian writer
and moralist, whom Gandhi admired and corresponded with. Besides
being an experiment in education, it was to house the families of
the satyagrahis and to give them a way to sustain themselves.
The Tolstoy Farm was the second of its kind established by
Gandhi. He had set up the Phoenix Farm in 1904 in Natal, inspired
by a reading of John Ruskin’s Unto This Last, a critique of
capitalism, and a work that extolled the virtues of the simple life
of love, labour, and the dignity of human beings. As at the Phoenix
settlement, at Tolstoy Farm too, manual work went hand-in-hand
with instruction. Vocational training was introduced to give “all-round
development to the boys and girls”. Co-educational classes were
held, and boys and girls were encouraged to work together. The
activities included general labour, cooking, scavenging, sandalmaking, simple carpentry and messenger work. Manual work such
as sweeping, scavenging and fetching water was perceived to be
invaluable to the psychological, social and moral well-being of an
integrated community. Gandhi’s objective in this context was to
inculcate the ideals of social service and citizenship besides a
healthy respect for manual work from the early formative years itself.
The farm worked till 1913.

women and many women were drawn into the movement
because of this indignity.
Protest against Transvaal Immigration Act The
Indians protested the Transvaal Immigration Act, by illegally
migrating from Natal into Transvaal. The government held
these Indians in jails. Miners and plantation workers went on
a lightning strike. In India, Gokhale toured the whole country
mobilising public opinion in support of the Indians in South

riches, nothing for comfort or praise, or promotion, but is simply

Africa. Even the viceroy, Lord Hardinge, condemned the
repression and called for an impartial enquiry.
Compromise Solution Eventually, through a series of
negotiations involving Gandhi, Lord Hardinge, C.F. Andrews
and General Smuts, an agreement was reached by which the
Government of South Africa conceded the major Indian
demands relating to the poll tax, the registration certificates
and marriages solemnised according to Indian rites, and
promised to treat the issue of Indian immigration in a
sympathetic manner.

Gandhi’s Experience in South Africa

(i) Gandhi found that the masses had immense capacity
to participate in and sacrifice for a cause that moved them.
(ii) He was able to unite Indians belonging to different
religions and classes, and men and women alike under his
leadership.
(iii) He also came to realise that at times the leaders
have to take decisions unpopular with their enthusiastic
supporters.
(iv) He was able to evolve his own style of leadership
and politics and new techniques of struggle on a limited scale,
untrammelled by the opposition of contending political
currents.

Gandhi’s Technique of Satyagraha
Gandhi evolved the technique of Satyagraha during his stay
in South Africa. It was based on truth and non-violence. He
combined some elements from Indian tradition with the
Christian requirement of turning the other cheek and the
philosophy of Tolstoy, who said that evil could best be
countered by non-violent resistance. Its basic tenets were as
follows:
● A satyagrahi was not to submit to what he considered
as wrong, but was to always remain truthful, non-violent and
fearless.
● A satyagrahi works on the principles of withdrawal
of cooperation and boycott.
● Methods of satyagraha include non-payment of taxes,
and declining honours and positions of authority.

316  
● A satyagrahi should be ready to accept suffering in
his struggle against the wrong-doer. This suffering was to be
a part of his love for truth.
● Even while carrying out his struggle against the
wrong-doer, a true satyagrahi would have no ill feeling for
the wrong-doer; hatred would be alien to his nature.
● A true satyagrahi would never bow before the evil,
whatever the consequence.
● Only the brave and strong could practise satyagraha;
it was not for the weak and cowardly. Even violence was
preferred to cowardice. Thought was never to be separated
from practice. In other words, ends could not justify the
means.

Gandhi in India
Gandhi returned to India in January 1915. His efforts in South
Africa were well known not only among the educated but also
among the masses. He decided to tour the country the next
one year and see for himself the condition of the masses.
He also decided not to take any position on any political
matter for at least one year. As for the political currents
prevalent at that time in India, he was convinced about the
limitations of moderate politics and was also not in favour
of Home Rule agitation which was becoming popular at that
time. He thought that it was not the best time to agitate for
Home Rule when Britain was in the middle of a war. He was
convinced that the only technique capable of meeting the
nationalist aims was a non-violent satyagraha. He also said
that he would join no political organisation unless it too
accepted the creed of non-violent satyagraha.
During 1917 and 1918, Gandhi was involved in three
struggles—in Champaran, Ahmedabad and Kheda—before he
launched the Rowlatt Satyagraha.

Champaran Satyagraha (1917)—First Civil
Disobedience
Gandhi was requested by Rajkumar Shukla, a local man, to
look into the problems of the farmers in context of indigo

Emergence of Gandhi

 317

planters of Champaran in Bihar. The European planters had
been forcing the peasants to grow indigo on 3/20 part of
the total land (called tinkathia system). When towards the
end of the nineteenth century German synthetic dyes replaced
indigo, the European planters demanded high rents and illegal
dues from the peasants in order to maximise their profits
before the peasants could shift to other crops. Besides, the
peasants were forced to sell the produce at prices fixed by
the Europeans.
When Gandhi, joined now by Rajendra Prasad, Mazharul-Haq, Mahadeo Desai, Narhari Parekh, and J.B. Kripalani,
reached Champaran to probe into the matter, the authorities
ordered him to leave the area at once. Gandhi defied the order
and preferred to face the punishment. This passive resistance
or civil disobedience of an unjust order was a novel method
at that time. Finally, the authorities retreated and permitted
Gandhi to make an enquiry. Now, the government appointed
a committee to go into the matter and nominated Gandhi as
a member. Gandhi was able to convince the authorities that
the tinkathia system should be abolished and that the
peasants should be compensated for the illegal dues extracted
from them. As a compromise with the planters, he agreed
that only 25 per cent of the money taken should be
compensated.
Within a decade, the planters left the area. Gandhi had
won the first battle of civil disobedience in India. Other
popular leaders associated with Champaran Satyagraha were
Brajkishore Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Ramnavmi Prasad
and Shambhusharan Varma.

Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918)—
First Hunger Strike
In March 1918, Gandhi intervened in a dispute between
cotton mill owners of Ahmedabad and the workers over the
issue of discontinuation of the plague bonus. The mill owners
wanted to withdraw the bonus. The workers were demanding
a rise of 50 per cent in their wages so that they could manage
in the times of wartime inflation (which doubled the prices
of food-grains, cloth, and other necessities) caused by

318  

Britain’s involvement in World War I. The mill owners were
ready to give only a 20 per cent wage hike. The workers went
on strike.
The relations between the workers and the mill owners
worsened with the striking workers being arbitrarily dismissed
and the mill owners deciding to bring in weavers from
Bombay. The workers of the mill turned to Anusuya Sarabhai
for help in fighting for justice. Anusuya Sarabhai was a social
worker who was also the sister of Ambalal Sarabhai, one of
the mill owners and the president of the Ahmedabad Mill
Owners Association (founded in 1891 to develop the textile
industry in Ahmedabad), for help in fighting for justice.
Anusuya Behn went to Gandhi, who was respected by the mill
owners and workers, and asked him to intervene and help
resolve the impasse between the workers and the employers.
Though Gandhi was a friend of Ambalal, he took up the
workers’ cause. Anusuya too supported the workers and was
one of the chief lieutenants of Gandhi’s. (It was Anusuya
Behn who went on later to form the Ahmedabad Textile
Labour Association in 1920.) Gandhi asked the workers to
go on a strike and demand a 35 per cent increase in wages
instead of 50 per cent.
Gandhi advised the workers to remain non-violent while
on strike. When negotiations with mill owners did not
progress, he himself undertook a fast unto death (his first)
to strengthen the workers’ resolve. But the fast also had the
effect of putting pressure on the mill owners who finally
agreed to submit the issue to a tribunal. The strike was
withdrawn. In the end, the tribunal awarded the workers a 35
per cent wage hike.

Kheda Satyagraha (1918)—First
Non-Cooperation
Because of drought in 1918, the crops failed in Kheda district
of Gujarat. According to the Revenue Code, if the yield was
less than one-fourth the normal produce, the farmers were
entitled to remission. The Gujarat Sabha, consisting of the
peasants, submitted petitions to the highest governing

Emergence of Gandhi

 319

authorities of the province requesting that the revenue
assessment for the year 1919 be suspended. The government,
however, remained adamant and said that the property of the
farmers would be seized if the taxes were not paid.
Gandhi asked the farmers not to pay the taxes. Gandhi,
however, was mainly the spiritual head of the struggle. It was
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and a group of other devoted
Gandhians, namely, Narahari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya and
Ravi Shankar Vyas,who went around the villages, organised
the villagers and told them what to do and gave the necessary
political leadership. Patel along with his colleagues organised
the tax revolt which the different ethnic and caste communities
of Kheda supported.
The revolt was remarkable in that discipline and unity
were maintained. Even when, on non-payment of taxes, the
government seized the farmers’ personal property, land and
livelihood, a vast majority of Kheda’s farmers did not desert
Sardar Patel. Gujaratis in other parts who sympathised with
the cause of the revolt helped by sheltering the relatives and
property of the protesting peasants. Those Indians who sought
to buy the confiscated lands were socially ostracised.
Ultimately, the government sought to bring about an
agreement with the farmers. It agreed to suspend the tax for
the year in question, and for the next; reduce the increase
in rate; and return all the confiscated property.
The struggle at Kheda brought a new awakening among
the peasantry. They became aware that they would not be free
of injustice and exploitation unless and until their country
achieved complete independence.

Gains from Champaran, Ahmedabad and
Kheda

● Gandhi demonstrated to the people the efficacy of
his technique of satyagraha.
● He found his feet among the masses and came to
have a surer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses
of the masses.
● He acquired respect and commitment of many,
especially the youth.

320  

Rowlatt Act, Satyagraha,
Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
While, on the one hand, the government dangled the carrot
of constitutional reforms (though of an unsatisfactory order),
on the other hand, it decided to arm itself with extraordinary
powers to suppress any discordant voice against the reforms.

The Rowlatt Act

Just six months before the Montford Reforms were to be
put into effect, two bills were introduced in the Imperial
Legislative Council. One of them was dropped, but the
other—an extension to the Defence of India Regulations Act
1915—was passed in March 1919. It was what was officially
called the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, but
popularly known as the Rowlatt Act. It was based on the
recommendations made in the previous year to the Imperial
Legislative Council by the Rowlatt Commission, headed by
the British judge, Sir Sidney Rowlatt, to investigate the
‘seditious conspiracy’ of the Indian people. (The committee
had recommended that activists should be deported or
imprisoned without trial for two years, and that even possession
of seditious newspapers would be adequate evidence of guilt.)
All the elected Indian members of the Imperial Legislative
Council voted against the bill but they were in a minority
and easily overruled by the official nominees. All the elected
Indian members—who included Mohammed Ali Jinnah,
Madan Mohan Malaviya and Mazhar Ul Haq – resigned in
protest.
The act allowed political activists to be tried without
juries or even imprisoned without trial. It allowed arrest of
Indians without warrant on the mere suspicion of ‘treason’.
Such suspects could be tried in secrecy without recourse to
legal help. A special cell consisting of three high court judges
was to try such suspects and there was no court of appeal
above that panel. This panel could even accept evidence not
acceptable under the Indian Evidences Act. The law of habeas
corpus, the basis of civil liberty, was sought to be suspended.
The object of the government was to replace the repressive

Emergence of Gandhi

 321

provisions of the wartime Defence of India Act (1915) by
a permanent law. So the wartime restrictions on freedom of
speech and assembly were re-imposed in India. There was
strict control over the press and the government was armed
with a variety of powers to deal with anything the authorities
chose to consider as terrorism or revolutionary tactics.

Satyagraha Against the Rowlatt Act—
First Mass Strike

Just when the Indians expected a huge advance towards selfrule as a reward for their contribution to the war, they were
given the Montford Reforms with its very limited scope and
the shockingly repressive Rowlatt Act. Not surprisingly the
Indians felt betrayed. More so Gandhi, who had been at the
forefront in offering cooperation in the British war effort,
and who had even offered to encourage recruitment of Indians
into the British Indian forces. He called the Rowlatt Act the
“Black Act” and argued that not everyone should get
punishment in response to isolated political crimes.
Gandhi called for a mass protest at all India level. But
soon, having seen the constitutional protest meet with
ruthless repression, Gandhi organised a Satyagraha Sabha and
roped in younger members of Home Rule Leagues and the
Pan Islamists. The forms of protest finally chosen included
observance of a nationwide hartal (strike) accompanied by
fasting and prayer, and civil disobedience against specific
laws, and courting arrest and imprisonment.
There was a radical change in the situation by now.
(i) The masses had found a direction; now they could
‘act’ instead of just giving verbal expression to their grievances.
(ii) From now onwards, peasants, artisans and the urban
poor were to play an increasingly important part in the
struggle.
(iii) Orientation of the national movement turned to the
masses permanently. Gandhi said that salvation would come
when masses were awakened and became active in politics.
Satyagraha was to be launched on April 6, 1919 but
before it could be launched, there were large-scale violent,
anti-British demonstrations in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi,
Ahmedabad, etc. Especially in Punjab, the situation became

322  

so very explosive due to wartime repression, forcible
recruitments and ravages of disease, that the Army had to
be called in. April 1919 saw the biggest and the most violent
anti-British upsurge since 1857. The Lieutenant Governor of
Punjab, Sir Michael O’Dwyer, is said to have used aircraft
strafing against the violent protestors.

Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (April 13, 1919)

Amritsar was the worst affected by violence. In the beginning
there was no violence by the protestors. Indians shut down
their shops and normal trade and the empty streets showed
the Indians’ displeasure at the British betrayal. On April 9,
two nationalist leaders, Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr Satyapal,
were arrested by the British officials without any provocation
except that they had addressed protest meetings, and taken
to some unknown destination. This caused resentment among
the Indian protestors who came out in thousands on April
10 to show their solidarity with their leaders. Soon the
protests turned violent because the police resorted to firing
in which some of the protestors were killed. Tension ran high.
In the riot that followed, five Englishmen are reported to have
been killed and Marcella Sherwood, an English woman
missionary going on a bicycle, was beaten up.
Troops were sent immediately to quell the disturbances.
Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer was the senior British
officer with the responsibility to impose martial law and
restore order. By then the city had returned to calm and the
protests that were being held were peaceful. Dyer, however,
issued a proclamation on April 13 (which was also Baisakhi)
forbidding people from leaving the city without a pass and
from organising demonstrations or processions, or assembling
in groups of more than three.
On Baisakhi day, a large crowd of people mostly from
neighbouring villages, unaware of the prohibitory orders in
the city, gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh, a popular place
for public events, to celebrate the Baisakhi festival. Local
leaders had also called for a protest meeting at the venue.
It is not clear how many in the 20,000 odd people collected
there were political protestors, but the majority were those
who had collected for the festival. Meanwhile, the meeting
had gone on peacefully, and two resolutions, one calling for

Emergence of Gandhi

 323

the repeal of the Rowlatt Act and the other condemning the
firing on April 10, had been passed. It was then that BrigadierGeneral Dyer arrived on the scene with his men.
The troops surrounded the gathering under orders from
General Dyer and blocked the only exit point and opened
fire on the unarmed crowd. No warning was issued, no
instruction to disperse was given. An unarmed gathering of
men, women and children was fired upon as they tried to
flee.
According to official British Indian sources, 379 were
identified dead, and approximately 1,100 were wounded. The
Indian National Congress, on the other hand, estimated more
than 1,500 were injured, and approximately 1,000 were
killed. But it is precisely known that 1650 bullets were fired
into the crowd. The incident was followed by uncivilised
brutalities on the inhabitants of Amritsar. Martial law was
proclaimed in the Punjab, and public floggings and other
humiliations were perpetrated. To take just one instance,
Indians were forced to crawl on their bellies down the road
on which the English missionary had been assaulted.
The entire nation was stunned. Rabindranath Tagore
renounced his knighthood in protest. Gandhi gave up the title
of Kaiser-i-Hind, bestowed by the British for his work during
the Boer War. Gandhi was overwhelmed by the atmosphere
of total violence and withdrew the movement on April 18,
1919.
Seen in an objective way, Dyer ensured the beginning
of the end of the British Raj.
What had happened in Amritsar made Gandhi declare
that cooperation with a ‘satanic regime’ was now impossible.
He realised that the cause of Indian independence from
British rule was morally righteous. The way to the noncooperation movement was ready.
According to the historian, A.P.J Taylor, the Jallianwala
Bagh massacre was the “decisive moment when Indians were
alienated from British rule”.
The events of 1919 were to shape Punjab’s politics of
resistance. Bhagat Singh was just 11 at the time of the
Jallianwala Bagh massacre. For Bhagat Singh’s Bharat
Naujawan Sabha, the massacre was to act as a symbol that
would help overcome the apathy that came in the wake of
the end of the non-cooperation movement.

The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in the
Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude
shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position
as British subjects in India ... [T]he very least that I can do
for my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving
voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised
into a dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges
of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context
of humiliation...
—Rabindranath Tagore in a letter to the Viceroy
No government deserves respect which holds cheap the liberty
of its subjects.
—M.K. Gandhi in Young India, after the
Jallianwala Bagh massacre

Udham Singh, who bore the name, Ram Mohammad
Singh Azad, later assassinated Michael O’Dwyer, the
Lieutenant-Governor who presided over the brutal British
suppression of the 1919 protests in Punjab. Udham Singh
was hanged in 1940 for his deed. (His ashes were returned
to India in 1974.)

The Hunter Committee of
Inquiry
The massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh shocked Indians and many
British as well. The Secretary of State for India, Edwin
Montagu, ordered that a committee of inquiry be formed to
investigate the matter. So, on October 14, 1919, the
Government of India announced the formation of the Disorders
Inquiry Committee, which came to be more widely and
variously known as the Hunter Committee/Commission
after the name of its chairman, Lord William Hunter, former
Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College
of Justice in Scotland. The purpose of the commission was
to “investigate the recent disturbances in Bombay, Delhi and
Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope
with them”.
There were three Indians among the members, namely,
Sir Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad, Vice-Chancellor of Bombay

Emergence of Gandhi

 325

University and advocate of the Bombay High Court; Pandit
Jagat Narayan, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Council
of the United Provinces; and Sardar Sahibzada Sultan Ahmad
Khan, lawyer from Gwalior State.
After meeting in Delhi on October 29, the committee
took statements from witnesses called in from Delhi,
Ahmedabad, Bombay and Lahore. In November, the committee
reached Lahore and examined the principal witnesses to the
events in Amritsar. Dyer was called before the committee.
He was confident that what he had done was only his duty.
Dyer stated that his intentions had been to strike terror
throughout the Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral
stature of the ‘rebels’. Dyer is reported to have explained
his sense of honour by saying, “I think it quite possible that
I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they
would have come back again and laughed, and I would have
made, what I consider, a fool of myself.” He also stated that
he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the
shooting as he did not consider it his job.
Though Dyer’s statement caused racial tensions among
the members of the committee, the final report, released in
March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer’s actions. The
report stated that the lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh
in the beginning was an error; the length of firing showed
a grave error; Dyer’s motive of producing a sufficient moral
effect was to be condemned; Dyer had overstepped the
bounds of his authority; there had been no conspiracy to
overthrow British rule in the Punjab. The minority report of
the Indian members further added that the proclamations
banning public meetings were insufficiently publicised; there
were innocent people in the crowd, and there had not been
any violence in the Bagh beforehand; Dyer should have either
ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil
authorities to do so; Dyer’s actions had been “inhuman and
un-British” and had greatly injured the image of British rule
in India.
The Hunter Committee did not impose any penal or
disciplinary action because Dyer’s actions were condoned by
various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).

326  

Also, before the Hunter Committee began its
proceedings, the government had passed an Indemnity Act for
the protection of its officers. The “white washing bill” as
the Indemnity Act was called, was severely criticised by
Motilal Nehru and others.
In England, it fell to the Secretary of State for War
at the time, Winston Churchill, to review the report of the
commission. In the House of Commons, Churchill (no lover
of Indians) condemned what had happened at Amritsar. He
called it “monstrous”. A former prime minister of Britain,
H.H. Asquith called it “one of the worst outrages in the whole
of our history”. The cabinet agreed with Churchill that Dyer
was a dangerous man and could not be allowed to continue
in his post. The decision that Dyer should be dismissed was
conveyed to the Army Council. In the end, Dyer was found
guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his
command in March 1920. He was recalled to England. No
legal action was taken against him; he drew half pay and
received his army pension.
Dyer was not, however, universally condemned. In the
House of Lords, most of the peers favoured Dyer and the
house passed a motion in his support. And the Morning Post
is reported to have raised a sum of 26,000 pounds for Dyer;
a famous contributor to the fund was Rudyard Kipling.
Strangely enough, the clergy of the Golden Temple, led
by Arur Singh, honoured Dyer by declaring him a Sikh. The
honouring of Dyer by the priests of Sri Darbar Sahib,
Amritsar, was one of the reasons behind the intensification
of the demand for reforming the management of Sikh shrines
already being voiced by societies such as the Khalsa Diwan
Majha and Central Majha Khalsa Diwan. This resulted in the
launch of what came to be known as the Gurudwara Reform
movement.

Congress View
The Indian National Congress appointed its own non-official
committee that included Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, Abbas
Tyabji, M.R. Jayakar and Gandhi. The Congress put forward
its own view. This view criticised Dyer’s act as inhuman and
also said that there was no justification in the introduction
of the martial law in Punjab.

Chapter 16

Non-Cooperation
Movement and
Khilafat Aandolan
During 1919-22, the British were opposed through two mass
movements—the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation. Though the
two movements emerged from separate issues, they adopted
a common programme of action—that of non-violent noncooperation. The Khilafat issue was not directly linked to
Indian politics but it provided the immediate background to
the movement and gave an added advantage of cementing
Hindu-Muslim unity against the British.

Background
The background to the two movements was provided by a
series of events after the First World War which belied all
hopes of the government’s generosity towards the Indian
subjects. The year 1919, in particular, saw a strong feeling
of discontent among all sections of Indians for various
reasons:
● The economic situation of the country in the postWar years had become alarming with a rise in prices of
commodities, decrease in production of Indian industries,
increase in burden of taxes and rents etc. Almost all sections
of society suffered economic hardship due to the war and
this strengthened the anti-British attitude.

and uncivilised face of the foreign rule.
● The Hunter Committee on the Punjab atrocities
proved to be an eyewash. In fact, the House of Lords (of
the British Parliament) endorsed General Dyer’s action and
the British public showed solidarity with General Dyer by
helping The Morning Post collect 30,000 pounds for him.
● The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms with their illconceived scheme of dyarchy failed to satisfy the rising
demand of the Indians for self-government.
The post-First World War period also saw the preparation
of the ground for common political action by Hindus and
Muslims—(i) the Lucknow Pact (1916) had stimulated
Congress-Muslim League cooperation; (ii) the Rowlatt Act
agitation brought Hindus and Muslims, and also other sections
of the society, together; and (iii) radical nationalist Muslims
like Mohammad Ali, Abul Kalam Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan
and Hasan Imam had now become more influential than the
conservative Aligarh school elements who had dominated the
League earlier. The younger elements advocated militant
nationalism and active participation in the nationalist
movement. They had strong anti-imperialist sentiments.
In this atmosphere the Khilafat issue emerged, around
which developed the historic Non-Cooperation Movement.

The Khilafat Issue
The Khilafat issue paved the way for the consolidation of
the emergence of a radical nationalist trend among the
younger generation of Muslims and the section of traditional
Muslim scholars who were becoming increasingly critical of
British rule. This time, they were angered by the treatment
meted out to Turkey by the British after the First World War.
The Muslims in India, as the Muslims all over the world,
regarded the sultan of Turkey as their spiritual leader, Khalifa,
so naturally their sympathies were with Turkey. During the
war, Turkey had allied with Germany and Austria against the
British. When the war ended, the British took a stern attitude
towards Turkey—Turkey was dismembered and the Khalifa
removed from power. This incensed Muslims all over the
world.

330  

In India, too, the Muslims demanded from the British
(i) that the Khalifa’s control over Muslim sacred places
should be retained, and (ii) the Khalifa should be left with
sufficient territories after territorial arrangements. In early
1919, a Khilafat Committee was formed under the leadership
of the Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali), Maulana
Azad, Ajmal Khan and Hasrat Mohani, to force the British
government to change its attitude towards Turkey. Thus, the
ground for a country-wide agitation was prepared.

Development of the Khalifat-NonCooperation Programme
For some time, the Khilafat leaders limited their actions to
meetings, petitions, deputations in favour of the Khilafat.
Later, however, a militant trend emerged, demanding an active
agitation such as stopping all cooperation with the British.
Thus, at the All India Khilafat Conference held in Delhi in
November 1919, a call was made for the boycott of British
goods. The Khilafat leaders also clearly spelt out that unless
peace terms after the War were favourable to Turkey they
would stop all cooperation with the Government. Gandhi, who
was the president of the All India Khilafat Committee, saw
in the issue a platform from which mass and united noncooperation could be declared against the Government.

Congress Stand on Khilafat Question
It was quite clear that the support of the Congress was
essential for the Khilafat movement to succeed. However,
although Gandhi was in favour of launching satyagraha and
non-cooperation against the government on the Khilafat
issue, the Congress was not united on this form of political
action. Tilak was opposed to having an alliance with Muslim
leaders over a religious issue and he was also sceptical of
satyagraha as an instrument of politics. According to Professor
Ravinder Kumar, Gandhi made a concerted bid to convince
Tilak of the virtues of satyagraha and of the expediency of
an alliance with the Muslim community over the Khilafat
issue. There was opposition to some of the other provisions
of the Gandhi’s non-cooperation programme also, such as
boycott of councils. Later, however, Gandhi was able to the

Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat...  331

get the approval of the Congress for his programme of
political action and the Congress felt inclined to support a
non-cooperation programme on the Khilafat question
because—
●
it was felt that this was a golden opportunity to
cement Hindu-Muslim unity and to bring Muslim
masses into the national movement; now different
sections of society—Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs,
Christians, peasants, artisans, capitalists, tribals,
women, students—could come into the national
movement by fighting for their own rights and
realising that the colonial rule was opposed to them;
●
the Congress was losing faith in constitutional
struggle, especially after the Punjab incidents and
the blatantly partisan Hunter Committee Report;
●
the Congress was aware that the masses were eager
to give expression to their discontent.

Muslim League Support to Congress

The Muslim League also decided to give full support to the
Congress and its agitation on political questions.

The Non-Cooperation Khilafat
Movement
February 1920 In early 1920, a joint Hindu-Muslim
deputation was sent to the viceroy to seek redress of
grievances on the issue of Khilafat, but the mission proved
abortive.
In February 1920, Gandhi announced that the issues of
the Punjab wrongs and constitutional advance had been overshadowed by the Khilafat question and that he would soon
lead a movement of non-cooperation if the terms of the peace
treaty failed to satisfy the Indian Muslims.
May 1920 The Treaty of Sevres with Turkey, signed
in May 1920, completely dismembered Turkey.
June 1920 An all-party conference at Allahabad
approved a programme of boycott of schools, colleges and
law courts, and asked Gandhi to lead it.

332  

August 31, 1920 The Khilafat Committee started a
campaign of non-cooperation and the movement was formally
launched. (Tilak had, incidentally, breathed his last on August
1, 1920.)
September 1920 At a special session in Calcutta, the
Congress approved a non-cooperation programme till the
Punjab and Khilafat wrongs were removed and swaraj was
established. The programme was to include—
●
boycott of government schools and colleges;
●
boycott of law courts and dispensation of justice
through panchayats instead;
●
boycott of legislative councils; (there were some
differences over this as some leaders like C.R. Das
were not willing to include a boycott of councils,
but bowed to Congress discipline; these leaders
boycotted elections held in November 1920 and the
majority of the voters too stayed away);
●
boycott of foreign cloth and use of khadi instead;
also practice of hand-spinning to be done;
●
renunciation of government honours and titles; the
second phase could include mass civil disobedience
including resignation from government service, and
non-payment of taxes.
During the movement, the participants were supposed
to work for Hindu-Muslim unity and for removal of
untouchability, all the time remaining non-violent.
December 1920 At the Nagpur session of the Indian
National Congress—
(i) The programme of non-cooperation was endorsed.
(ii) An important change was made in the Congress
creed: now, instead of having the attainment of self-government
through constitutional means as its goal, the Congress
decided to have the attainment of swaraj through peaceful
and legitimate means, thus committing itself to an extraconstitutional mass struggle.
(iii) Some important organisational changes were made:
a congress working committee (CWC) of 15 members was
set up to lead the Congress from now onwards; provincial
congress committees on linguistic basis were organised;

Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat...  333

ward committees was organised; and entry fee was reduced
to four annas.
(iv) Gandhi declared that if the non-cooperation
programme was implemented completely, swaraj would be
ushered in within a year.
Many groups of revolutionary terrorists, especially
those from Bengal, also pledged support to the Congress
programme.
At this stage, some leaders like Mohammad Ali Jinnah,
Annie Besant, G.S. Kharpade and B.C. Pal left the Congress
as they believed in a constitutional and lawful struggle while
some others like Surendranath Banerjea founded the Indian
National Liberal Federation and played a minor role in
national politics henceforward.
The adoption by the Congress of the non-cooperation
movement initiated earlier by the Khilafat Committee gave
it a new energy, and the years 1921 and 1922 saw an unprecedented popular upsurge.

Spread of the Movement
Gandhi accompanied by the Ali brothers undertook a nationwide
tour. Thousands of students left government schools and
colleges and joined around 800 national schools and colleges
which cropped up during this time. These educational
institutions were organised under the leadership of Acharya
Narendra Dev, C.R. Das, Lala Lajpat Rai, Zakir Hussain,
Subhash Bose (who became the principal of National
College at Calcutta) and included Jamia Millia at Aligarh,
Kashi Vidyapeeth, Gujarat Vidyapeeth and Bihar
Vidyapeeth.
Many lawyers gave up their practice, some of whom
were Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Vallabhbhai Patel, Asaf Ali,
T. Prakasam and Rajendra Prasad.
Heaps of foreign cloth were burnt publicly and their
imports fell by half. Picketing of shops selling foreign liquor
and of toddy shops was undertaken at many places.
The Tilak Swaraj Fund was oversubscribed and one
crore rupees collected.

334  

Congress volunteer corps emerged as the parallel
police.
In July 1921, the Ali brothers gave a call to the
Muslims to resign from the Army as it was unreligious. The
Ali brothers were arrested for this in September. Gandhi
echoed their call and asked local Congress committees to
pass similar resolutions to that effect.
Now, the Congress gave a call to local Congress bodies
to start civil disobedience if it was thought that the people
were ready for it. Already, a no-tax movement against union
board taxes in Midnapore (Bengal) and in Guntur (Andhra)
was going on.
In Assam, strikes in tea plantations, steamer services
and Assam-Bengal Railways had been organised. J.M. Sengupta
was a prominent leader in these strikes.
In November 1921, the visit of the Prince of Wales
to India invited strikes and demonstrations.
The spirit of defiance and unrest gave rise to many local
struggles such as Awadh Kisan Movement (UP), Eka Movement
(UP), Mappila Revolt (Malabar) and the Sikh agitation for
the removal of mahants in Punjab.

People’s Response

The participation in the movement was from a wide range
of the society but to a varying extent.
Middle Class
People from the middle classes led the movement at the
beginning but later they showed a lot of reservations about
Gandhi’s programme. In places like Calcutta, Bombay and
Madras, which were centres of elite politicians, the response
to Gandhi’s call was very limited. The response to the call
for resignation from the government service, surrendering of
titles, etc., was not taken seriously. The comparative
newcomers in Indian politics found expression of their
interests and aspirations in the movement. Rajendra Prasad
in Bihar and Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat provided solid
support and, in fact, leaders like them found non-cooperation
to be a viable political alternative to terrorism in order to
fight against a colonial government.

Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat...  335

Business Class
The economic boycott received support from the Indian
business group because they had benefited from the
nationalists’ emphasis on the use of swadeshi. But a section
of the big business remained sceptical towards the movement.
They seemed to be afraid of labour unrest in their factories.
Peasants
Peasants’ participation was massive. Although the Congress
was against class war, the masses broke this restraint. In
Bihar, the confrontation between the ‘lower and upper castes’
on the issue of the former taking the sacred thread got
merged with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In general, the
peasants turned against the landlords and the traders. The
movement gave an opportunity to the toiling masses to
express their real feelings against the British as well as
against their Indian masters and oppressors (landlords and
traders).
Students
Students became active volunteers of the movement and
thousands of them left government schools and colleges and
joined national schools and colleges. The newly opened
national institutions like the Kashi Vidyapeeth, the Gujarat
Vidyapeeth and the Jamila Milia Islamia and others
accommodated many students.
Women
Women gave up purdah and offered their ornaments for the
Tilak Fund. They joined the movement in large numbers and
took active part in picketing before the shops selling foreign
cloth and liquor.
Hindu-Muslim Unity
The massive participation of Muslims and the maintenance
of communal unity, despite the events like Moppila Uprisings,
were great achievements. In many places, two-thirds of those
arrested were Muslims, and such type of participation had
neither been seen in the past nor would be seen in the future.
Gandhi and other leaders addressed the Muslim masses from
mosques, and Gandhi was even allowed to address meetings
of Muslim women in which he was the only male who was
not blind-folded.

336  

Government Response
Talks between Gandhi and Reading, the viceroy, broke down
in May 1921 as the government wanted Gandhi to urge the
Ali brothers to remove those portions from speeches which
suggested violence. Gandhi realised that the government was
trying to drive a wedge between him and the Khilafat leaders
and refused to fall into the trap. In December, the government
came down heavily on the protestors. Volunteer corps were
declared illegal, public meetings were banned, the press was
gagged and most of the leaders barring Gandhi were arrested.

The Last Phase of the Movement

Gandhi was now under increasing pressure from the Congress
rank and file to start the civil disobedience programme. The
Ahmedabad session in 1921 (presided over, incidentally, by
C.R. Das while still in jail; Hakim Ajmal Khan was the acting
president) appointed Gandhi the sole authority on the issue.
On February 1, 1922 Gandhi threatened to launch civil
disobedience from Bardoli (Gujarat) if (i) political prisoners
were not released, and (ii) press controls were not removed.
The movement had hardly begun before it was brought to an
abrupt end.
Chauri Chaura Incident
A small sleepy village named Chauri-Chaura (Gorakhpur
district in United Provinces) has found a place in history
books due to an incident of violence on February 5, 1922
which was to prompt Gandhi to withdraw the movement. The
police here had beaten up the leader of a group of volunteers
campaigning against liquor sale and high food prices, and then
opened fire on the crowd which had come to protest before
the police station. The agitated crowd torched the police
station with policemen inside who had taken shelter there;
those who tried to flee were hacked to death and thrown back
into the fire. Twenty-two policemen were killed in the
violence. Gandhi, not happy with the increasingly violent
trend of the movement, immediately announced the withdrawal
of the movement.
The Congress Working Committee met at Bardoli in
February 1922 and resolved to stop all activity that led to

Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat...  337
Views
To sound the order of retreat just when public enthusiasm was
reaching the boiling point was nothing short of a national calamity.
The principal lieutenants of the Mahatma, Deshbandhu Das,
Pandit Motilal Nehru and Lala Lajpat Rai, who were all in prison,
shared the popular resentment.
—Subhas Chandra Bose
A mass wave of revolutionary unrest in India in 1919 (evident
from the labour unrest and strike wave of 1919-20 and peasant
protests in UP and Bihar) ..... worked as a kind of popular groundswell virtually forcing the leadership to a radical posture...Gandhi
and the Congress bigwigs sensed that a revolutionary mass
movement was in the offing. They decided to take over the
leadership to keep the movement a ‘controlled’ affair and ‘within
safe channels’. The movement was called off just when the
masses seemed to be taking the initiative.
—Marxist Interpretation
I would suffer every humiliation, every torture, absolute ostracism
and death itself to prevent the movement from becoming violent.
—M.K. Gandhi, in Young India, February 16, 1922

breaking of the law and to get down to constructive work,
instead, which was to include popularisation of khadi, national
schools, and campaigning for temperance, for Hindu-Muslim
unity and against untouchability.
Most of the nationalist leaders including C.R. Das,
Motilal Nehru, Subhash Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, however,
expressed their bewilderment at Gandhi’s decision to withdraw
the movement.
In March 1922, Gandhi was arrested and sentenced to
six years in jail. He made the occasion memorable by a
magnificent court speech: “I am here, therefore, to invite and
submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted
upon me for what in law is deliberate crime, and what appears
to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.”

Why Gandhi Withdrew the
Movement
Gandhi felt that people had not learnt or fully understood
the method of non-violence. Incidents like Chauri-Chaura

338  

could lead to the kind of excitement and fervour that would
turn the movement to become generally violent. A violent
movement could be easily suppressed by the colonial regime
who would make the incidents of violence an excuse for using
the armed might of the State against the protestors.
The movement was also showing signs of fatigue. This
was natural as it is not possible to sustain any movement
at a high pitch for very long. The government seemed to be
in no mood for negotiations.
The central theme of the agitation—the Khilafat
question—also dissipated soon. In November 1922, the
people of Turkey rose under Mustafa Kamal Pasha and
deprived the sultan of political power. Turkey was made a
secular state. Thus, the Khilafat question lost its relevance.
A European style of legal system was established in Turkey
and extensive rights granted to women. Education was
nationalised and modern agriculture and industries developed.
In 1924, the caliphate was abolished.

Evaluation of Khilafat
Non-Cooperation Movement
The movement brought the urban Muslims into the national
movement, but at the same time it communalised the national
politics, to an extent. Although Muslim sentiments were a
manifestation of the spread of a wider anti-imperialist
feeling, the national leaders failed to raise the religious
political consciousness of the Muslims to a level of secular
political consciousness.
With the Non-Cooperation Movement, nationalist
sentiments reached every nook and corner of the country and
politicised every strata of population—the artisans, peasants,
View
It (Khilafat movement) was a purely retrograde and reactionary
movement, and more importantly for Indian nationalism, it was
an intrinsically anti-nationalist movement pitting specifically
Islamic interests against secular and non-Muslim interests.
—Dr. Koenraad Elst

Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat...  339

students, urban poor, women, traders, etc. It was this
politicisation and activisation of millions of men and women
which imparted a revolutionary character to the national
movement. Colonial rule was based on two myths—one, that
such a rule was in the interest of Indians and two, that it
was invincible. The first myth had been exploded by the
economic critique by Moderate nationalists. The second myth
had been challenged by satyagraha through mass struggle.
Now, the masses lost the hitherto all-pervasive fear of the
colonial rule and its mighty repressive organs.
Summary
●

Khilafat-Non-Cooperation Movement

Chapter 17

Emergence of Swarajists,
Socialist Ideas,
Revolutionary Activities
and Other New Forces
Swarajists and No-Changers
Genesis of Congress-Khilafat Swarajya
Party
After Gandhi’s arrest (March 1922), there was disintegration,
disorganisation and demoralisation among nationalist ranks.
A debate started among Congressmen on what to do during
the transition period, i.e., the passive phase of the movement.
One section led by C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru and Ajmal
Khan wanted an end to the boycott of legislative councils
so that the nationalists could enter them to expose the basic
weaknesses of these assemblies and use these councils as
an arena of political struggle to arouse popular enthusiasm.
They wanted, in other words, to ‘end or mend’ these councils,
i.e., if the government did not respond to the nationalists’
demands, then they would obstruct the working of these
councils.
Those advocating entry into legislative councils came
340

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 341

to be known as the ‘Swarajists’, while the other school of
thought led by C. Rajagopalachari, Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra
Prasad and M.A. Ansari came to be known as the ‘Nochangers’. The ‘No-changers’ opposed council entry, advocated
concentration on constructive work, and continuation of
boycott and non-cooperation, and quiet preparation for
resumption of the suspended civil disobedience programme.
The differences over the question of council entry
between the two schools of thought resulted in the defeat
of the Swarajists’ proposal of ‘ending or mending’ the
councils at the Gaya session of the Congress (December
1922). C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru resigned from the
presidentship and secretaryship respectively of the Congress
and announced the formation of Congress-Khilafat Swarajya
Party or simply Swarajist Party, with C.R. Das as the
president and Motilal Nehru as one of the secretaries.

Swarajists’ Arguments

The Swarajists had their reasons for advocating the entry into
the councils.
● Entering the councils would not negate the noncooperation programme; in fact, it would be like carrying on
the movement through other means—opening a new front.
● In a time of political vacuum, council work would
serve to enthuse the masses and keep up their morale. Entry
of nationalists would deter the government from stuffing the
councils with undesirable elements who may be used to
provide legitimacy to government measures.
● The councils could be used as an arena of political
struggle; there was no intention to use the councils as organs
for gradual transformation of colonial rule.

No-Changers’ Arguments
The No-Changers argued that parliamentary work would lead
to neglect of constructive work, loss of revolutionary zeal
and to political corruption. Constructive work would prepare
everyone for the next phase of civil disobedience.

Agree to Disagree

Both sides, however, wanted to avoid a 1907-type split and
kept in touch with Gandhi who was in jail. Both sides also

342  

realised the significance of putting up a united front to get
a mass movement to force the government to introduce
reforms, and both sides accepted the necessity of Gandhi’s
leadership of a united nationalist front. Keeping these factors
in mind, a compromise was reached at a meeting in Delhi
in September 1923.
The Swarajists were allowed to contest elections as a
group within the Congress. The Swarajists accepted the
Congress programme with only one difference—that they
would join legislative councils. The elections to the newly
constituted Central Legislative Assembly and to provincial
assemblies were to be held in November 1923.

The Swarajist Manifesto for Elections

Released in October 1923, the Swarajist manifesto took a
strong anti-imperialist line. The points put forward were as
follows.
● The guiding motive of the British in governing India
lay in selfish interests of their own country;
● The so-called reforms were only a blind to further
the said interests under the pretence of granting a responsible
government, the real objective being to continue exploitation
of the unlimited resources of the country by keeping Indians
permanently in a subservient position to Britain;
● The Swarajists would present the nationalist demand
of self-government in councils;
● If this demand was rejected, they would adopt a policy
of uniform, continuous and consistent obstruction within the
councils to make governance through councils impossible;
● Councils would thus be wrecked from within by
creating deadlocks on every measure.

Gandhi’s Attitude

Gandhi was initially opposed to the Swarajist proposal of
council entry. But after his release from prison on health
grounds in February 1924, he gradually moved towards a
reconciliation with the Swarajists.
● He felt public opposition to the programme of
council entry would be counter-productive.
● In the November 1923 elections, the Swarajists had

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 343

managed to win 42 out of 141 elected seats and a clear
majority in the provincial assembly of Central Provinces. In
legislatures, in cooperation with the Liberals and the
independents like Jinnah and Malaviya, they won a majority.
The courageous and uncompromising manner in which the
Swarajists functioned convinced him that they would not
become just another limb of colonial administration.
● There was a government crackdown on revolutionary
terrorists and the Swarajists towards the end of 1924; this
angered Gandhi and he expressed his solidarity with the
Swarajists by surrendering to their wishes.
Both sides came to an agreement in 1924 (endorsed
at the Belgaum session of the Congress in December 1924
over which Gandhi—the only time—presided over the
Congress session) that the Swarajists would work in the
councils as an integral part of the Congress.

Swarajist Activity in Councils

Gradually, the Swarajist position had weakened because of
widespread communal riots, and a split among Swarajists
themselves on communal and Responsivist-Non-responsivist
lines. The government strategy of dividing the Swarajists—
the more militant from the moderate, the Hindus from the
Muslims—was successful. The Swarajists lost the support of
many Muslims when the party did not support the tenants’
cause against the zamindars in Bengal (most of the tenants
were Muslims). Communal interests also entered the party.
The death of C.R. Das in 1925 weakened it further.
The Responsivists among Swarajists—Lala Lajpat Rai,
Madan Mohan Malaviya and N.C. Kelkar—advocated
cooperation with the government and holding of office
wherever possible. Besides they also wanted to protect the
so-called Hindu interests. The communal elements accused
leaders like Motilal Nehru, who did not favour joining the
council, of being anti-Hindu even as Muslim communalists
called the Swarajists anti-Muslim.
Thus, the main leadership of the Swarajist Party reiterated
faith in mass civil disobedience and withdrew from legislatures
in March 1926, while another section of Swarajists went into
the 1926 elections as a party in disarray, and did not fare

344  

well on the whole. They won 40 seats in the Centre and some
seats in Madras but were routed in the United Provinces, the
Central Provinces and Punjab.
In 1930, the Swarajists finally walked out as a result
of the Lahore Congress resolution on purna swaraj and the
beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
Achievements
(i) With coalition partners, they out-voted the government
several times, even on matters relating to budgetary grants,
and passed adjournment motions.
(ii) They agitated through powerful speeches on selfgovernment, civil liberties and industrialisation.
(iii) Vithalbhai Patel was elected speaker of Central
Legislative Assembly in 1925.
(iv) A noteworthy achievement was the defeat of the
Public Safety Bill in 1928 which was aimed at empowering
the Government to deport undesirable and subversive
foreigners (because the Government was alarmed by the
spread of socialist and communist ideas and believed that a
crucial role was being played by the British and other foreign
activists being sent by the Commintern).
(v) By their activities, they filled the political vacuum
at a time when the national movement was recouping its
strength.
(vi) They exposed the hollowness of the Montford
scheme.
(vii) They demonstrated that the councils could be used
creatively.
Drawbacks
(i) The Swarajists lacked a policy to coordinate their
militancy inside legislatures with the mass struggle outside.
They relied totally on newspaper reporting to communicate
with the public.
(ii) An obstructionist strategy had its limitations.
(iii) They could not carry on with their coalition
partners very far because of conflicting ideas, which further
limited their effectiveness.
(iv) They failed to resist the perks and privileges of
power and office.
(v) They failed to support the peasants’ cause in Bengal

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 345

and lost support among Muslim members who were propeasant.

Constructive Work by No-Changers

The No-Changers devoted themselves to constructive work
that connected them to the different sections of the masses.
(i) Ashrams sprang up where young men and women
worked among tribals and lower castes (especially in Kheda
and Bardoli areas of Gujarat), and popularised the use of
charkha and khadi.
(ii) National schools and colleges were set up where
students were trained in a non-colonial ideological framework.
(iii) Significant work was done for Hindu-Muslim unity,
removing untouchability, boycott of foreign cloth and liquor,
and for flood relief.
(iv) The constructive workers served as the backbone
of civil disobedience as active organisers.
A Critique of Constructive Work
National education benefited the urban lower middle classes
and the rich peasants only. Enthusiasm for national education
surfaced in the excitement of the movement only. In passivity,
the lure of degrees and jobs took the students to official
schools and colleges.
Popularisation of khadi was an uphill task since it was
costlier than the imported cloth.
While campaigning about the social aspect of
untouchability, no emphasis was laid on the economic
grievances of the landless and agricultural labourers comprising
mostly the untouchables.
Although the Swarajists and the No-changers worked
in their separate ways, they kept on best of terms with one
another and were able to unite whenever the time was ripe
for a new political struggle.

Emergence of New Forces:
Socialistic Ideas, Youth Power,
Trade Unionism
The third decade of the twentieth century is a watershed in
modern Indian history in more ways than one. While, on the

346  

one hand, this period marked the entry of Indian masses into
the national movement, on the other hand, this period saw
the basic crystallisation of the main political currents on the
national scene. These diverse political currents owed their
origin partly to the coming on the scene of the Gandhian
philosophy of satyagraha based on truth and non-violence, as
they embodied a positive or negative reaction to it. The
international influence on Indian political thinkers during this
phase was also more pronounced than before.
The new forces to emerge during the 1920s included
the following.

Spread of Marxist and Socialist Ideas
Ideas of Marx and Socialist thinkers inspired many groups
to come into existence as socialists and communists. These
ideas also resulted in the rise of a left wing within the
Congress, represented by Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash
Chandra Bose. These young nationalists, inspired by the
Soviet Revolution and dissatisfied with Gandhian ideas and
political programme, began advocating radical solutions for
economic, political and social ills of the country. These
younger nationalists—
● were critical of both Swarajists and No-Changers;
● advocated a more consistent anti-imperialist line in
the form of a slogan for purna swarajya (complete
independence);
● were influenced by an awareness, though still vague,
of international currents;
● stressed the need to combine nationalism and antiimperialism with social justice and simultaneously
raised the question of internal class oppression by
capitalists and landlords.
The Communist Party of India (CPI) was formed in
1920 in Tashkent (now, the capital of Uzbekistan) by M.N.
Roy, Abani Mukherji and others after the second Congress
of Commintern. M.N. Roy was also the first to be elected
to the leadership of Commintern.
In 1924, many communists—S.A. Dange, Muzaffar
Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani, Nalini Gupta—were jailed in the
Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case.

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 347

In 1925, the Indian Communist Conference at Kanpur
formalised the foundation of the CPI.
In 1929, the government crackdown on communists
resulted in the arrest and trial of 31 leading communists,
trade unionists and left-wing leaders; they were tried at
Meerut in the famous Meerut conspiracy case.
Workers’ and peasants’ parties were organised all over
the country and they propagated Marxist and communist
ideas.
All these communist groups and workers’ and peasants’
parties remained an integral part of the national movement
and worked along with the Congress.

Activism of Indian Youth

All over, students’ leagues were being established and
students’ conferences were being held. In 1928, Jawaharlal
Nehru presided over the All Bengal Students’ Conference.

Peasants’ Agitations

In the United Provinces peasant agitations were for revision
of tenancy laws, lower rents, protection against eviction and
relief from indebtedness. Similar peasant agitations took
place in the Rampa region of Andhra, in Rajasthan, in ryotwari
areas of Bombay and Madras. In Gujarat, the Bardoli Satyagraha
was led by Vallabhbhai Patel (1928).

Growth of Trade Unionism

The trade union movement was led by All India Trade Union
Congress (AITUC) founded in 1920. Lala Lajpat Rai was its
first president and Dewan Chaman Lal its general secretary.
Tilak was also one of the moving spirits. The major strikes
during the 1920s included those in Kharagpur Railway
Workshops,Tata Iron and Steel Works (Jamshedpur), Bombay
Textile Mills (this involved 1,50,000 workers and went on
for 5 months), and Buckingham Carnatic Mills. In 1928, there
were a number of strikes involving 5 lakh workers. In 1923,
the first May Day was celebrated in India in Madras.

Caste Movements

As in earlier periods, the varied contradictions of the Indian
society found expression in caste associations and movements.
These movements could be divisive, conservative and at times
potentially radical, and included:

348  

Justice Party (Madras)
Self-respect movement (1925) under “Periyar”—E.V.
Ramaswamy Naicker (Madras)
● Satyashodhak activists in Satara (Maharashtra)
● Bhaskar Rao Jadhav (Maharashtra)
● Mahars under Ambedkar (Maharashtra)
● Radical Ezhavas under K. Aiyappan and C. Kesavan
in Kerala
● Yadavs in Bihar for improvement in social status
● Unionist Party under Fazl-i-Hussain (Punjab).
●

Revolutionary Activity with a Turn towards
Socialism
This line was adopted by those dissatisfied with the nationalist
strategy of the political struggle with its emphasis on nonviolence. Here, too, two strands developed—
● Hindustan Republican Association (H.R.A.)—in
Punjab-UP-Bihar
● Yugantar, Anushilan groups and later Chittagong
Revolt Group under Surya Sen—in Bengal

Revolutionary Activity During
the 1920s
Why Attraction for Revolutionary Activity
after Non-Cooperation Movement

The revolutionaries had faced severe repression during the
First World War. But in early 1920, many were released by
the government under a general amnesty to create a harmonious
environment for the Montford Reforms to work. Soon,
Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement. Under the
persuasion of Gandhi and C.R. Das, many revolutionary
groups either agreed to join the non-cooperation programme
or suspended their activities to give the non-violent NonCooperation Movement a chance.
The sudden withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation
Movement, however, left many of them disillusioned; they
began to question the basic strategy of nationalist leadership
and its emphasis on non-violence and began to look for

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 349

alternatives. But since these younger nationalists were not
attracted to the parliamentary work of the Swarajists or to
the patient, undramatic, constructive work of the No-changers,
they were drawn to the idea that violent methods alone would
free India. Thus, revolutionary activity was revived.
Nearly all major leaders of revolutionary policies had
been enthusiastic participants in the Non-Cooperation
Movement and included Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Surya
Sen, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Chandrasekhar Azad, Shiv Verma,
Bhagwaticharan Vohra, Jaidev Kapur and Jatin Das. Two
separate strands of revolutionary groups emerged during this
period—one operating in Punjab-UP-Bihar and the other in
Bengal.

Major Influences

(i) Upsurge of working class trade unionism after the
War; the revolutionaries wanted to harness the revolutionary
potential of the new emergent class for nationalist revolution.
(ii) Russian Revolution (1917) and the success of the
young Soviet state in consolidating itself.
(iii) Newly sprouting communist groups with their
emphasis on Marxism, socialism and the proletariat.
(iv) Journals publishing memoirs and articles extolling
the self-sacrifice of revolutionaries, such as Atmasakti,
Sarathi and Bijoli.
(v) Novels and books such as Bandi Jiwan by Sachin
Sanyal and Pather Dabi by Sharatchandra Chatterjee (a
government ban only enhanced its popularity).

In Punjab-United Provinces-Bihar

The revolutionary activity in this region was dominated by
the Hindustan Republican Association/Army or HRA
(later renamed Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
or HSRA). The HRA was founded in October 1924 in Kanpur
by Ramprasad Bismil, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Sachin
Sanyal, with an aim to organise an armed revolution to
overthrow the colonial government and establish in its place
the Federal Republic of United States of India whose basic
principle would be adult franchise.
Kakori Robbery (August 1925)
The most important action of the HRA was the Kakori
robbery. The men held up the 8-Down train at Kakori, an

350  

obscure village near Lucknow, and looted its official railway
cash. Government crackdown after the Kakori robbery led
to arrests of many, of whom 17 were jailed, four transported
for life and four—Bismil, Ashfaqullah, Roshan Singh and
Rajendra Lahiri—were hanged. Kakori proved to be a setback.
The HSRA
Determined to overcome the Kakori setback, the younger
revolutionaries, inspired by socialist ideas, set out to reorganise
Hindustan Republic Association at a historic meeting in the
ruins of Ferozshah Kotla in Delhi (September 1928). Under
the leadership of Chandra Shekhar Azad, the name of HRA
was changed to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
(HSRA). The participants included Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev,
Bhagwaticharan Vohra from Punjab and Bejoy Kumar Sinha,
Shiv Verma and Jaidev Kapur from the United Provinces. The
HSRA decided to work under a collective leadership and
adopted socialism as its official goal.
Saunders’ Murder (Lahore, December 1928)
Just when the HSRA revolutionaries had begun to move away
from individual heroic action, the death of Sher-i-Punjab Lala
Lajpat Rai due to lathi blows received during a lathi- charge
on an anti-Simon Commission procession (October 1928)
led them once again to take to individual assassination. Bhagat
Singh, Azad and Rajguru shot dead Saunders, the police
official responsible for the lathicharge in Lahore. The
assassination was justified with these words: “The murder of
a leader respected by millions of people at the unworthy
hands of an ordinary police officer...was an insult to the
nation. It was the bounden duty of young men of India to
efface it... We regret to have had to kill a person but he was
part and parcel of that inhuman and unjust order which has
to be destroyed.”
Bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly
(April 1929)
The HSRA leadership now decided to let the people know
about its changed objectives and the need for a revolution
by the masses. Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were asked
to throw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly on April
8, 1929 to protest against the passage of the Public Safety

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 351

Bill and Trade Disputes Bill aimed at curtailing civil liberties
of citizens in general and workers in particular. The bombs
had been deliberately made harmless and were aimed at
making ‘the deaf hear’. The objective was to get arrested and
to use the trial court as a forum for propaganda so that people
would become familiar with their movement and ideology.
Action against the Revolutionaries
Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were tried in the Lahore
conspiracy case. Many other revolutionaries were tried in a
series of other cases. In jail, these revolutionaries protested
against the horrible conditions through fasting, and demanded
honourable and decent treatment as political prisoners. Jatin
Das became the first martyr on the 64th day of his fast. The
defence of these young revolutionaries was organised by
Congress leaders. Bhagat Singh became a household name.
Azad was involved in a bid to blow up Viceroy Irwin’s
train near Delhi in December 1929. During 1930 there were
a series of violent actions in Punjab and towns of United
Provinces (26 incidents in 1930 in Punjab alone).
Azad died in a police encounter in a park in Allahabad
in February 1931. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were
hanged on March 23, 1931.

In Bengal

During the 1920s many revolutionary groups reorganised
their underground activities, while many continued working
under the Congress, thus getting access to the masses and
providing an organisational base to the Congress in towns
and villages. Many cooperated with C.R. Das in his Swarajist
work. After Das’s death (1925), the Bengal Congress broke
up into two factions—one led by J.M. Sengupta (Anushilan
group joined forces with him) and the other led by Subhash
Bose (Yugantar group backed him).
The actions of the reorganised groups included an
assassination attempt on the notorious Calcutta Police
Commissioner, Charles Tegart (another man named Day got
killed) by Gopinath Saha in 1924. The government, armed
with a new ordinance, came down heavily on revolutionaries.
Many including Subhash Bose were arrested. Gopinath Saha
was hanged.

352  

Because of government repression and factionalism
among the revolutionaries, revolutionary activity suffered a
setback, but soon many of revolutionaries started regrouping.
Among the new ‘Revolt Groups’, the most active and famous
was the Chittagong group under Surya Sen.
Chittagong Armoury Raid (April 1930)
Surya Sen had participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement
and had become a teacher in the national school in Chittagong.
He was imprisoned from 1926 to 1928 for revolutionary
activity and afterwards continued working in the Congress.
He was the secretary of the Chittagong District Congress
Committee. He used to say ”Humanism is a special virtue
of a revolutionary.” He was a lover of poetry and an admirer
of Tagore and Qazi Nazrul Islam.
Surya Sen decided to organise an armed rebellion along
with his associates—Anant Singh, Ganesh Ghosh and Lokenath
Baul—to show that it was possible to challenge the armed
might of the mighty British Empire. They had planned to
occupy two main armouries in Chittagong to seize and supply
arms to the revolutionaries to destroy telephone and telegraph
lines and to dislocate the railway link of Chittagong with the
rest of Bengal. The raid was conducted in April 1930 and
involved 65 activists under the banner of Indian Republican
Army—Chittagong Branch. The raid was quite successful;
Sen hoisted the national flag, took salute and proclaimed a
provisional revolutionary government. Later, they dispersed
into neighbouring villages and raided government targets.
Surya Sen was arrested in February 1933 and hanged
in January 1934, but the Chittagong raid fired the imagination
of the revolutionary-minded youth and recruits poured into
the revolutionary groups in a steady stream.
Aspects of the New Phase of Revolutionary
Movement in Bengal
Some noteworthy aspects were as follows.
● There was a large-scale participation of young women
especially under Surya Sen. These women provided shelter,
carried messages and fought with guns in hand. Prominent

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 353

women revolutionaries in Bengal during this phase included
Pritilata Waddedar, who died conducting a raid; Kalpana
Dutt who was arrested and tried along with Surya Sen and
given a life sentence; Santi Ghosh and Suniti Chandheri,
school girls of Comilla, who shot dead the district magistrate.
(December 1931); and Bina Das who fired point blank at
the governor while receiving her degree at the convocation
(February 1932).
● There was an emphasis on group action aimed at
organs of the colonial State, instead of individual action. The
objective was to set an example before the youth and to
demoralise the bureaucracy.
● Some of the earlier tendency towards Hindu religiosity
was shed, and there were no more rituals like oath-taking,
and this facilitated participation by Muslims. Surya Sen had
Muslims such as Satar, Mir Ahmed, Fakir Ahmed Mian and
Tunu Mian in his group.
There were some drawbacks too:
● The movement retained some conservative elements.
● It failed to evolve broader socio-economic goals.
● Those working with Swarajists failed to support the
cause of Muslim peasantry against zamindars in Bengal.

Official Reaction

There was panic at first and then severe government repression.
Armed with 20 repressive Acts, the government let loose the
police on the revolutionaries. In Chittagong, several villages
were burned and punitive fines imposed on many others. In
1933, Jawaharlal Nehru was arrested for sedition and given
two years’ sentence because he had condemned imperialism
and praised the heroism of the revolutionaries.

Ideological Rethinking

A real breakthrough was made by Bhagat Singh and his
comrades in terms of revolutionary ideology, forms of
revolutionary struggle and the goals of revolution. The
rethinking had begun in the mid-1920s. The Founding Council
of HRA had decided to preach revolutionary and communist

354  

principles, and the HRA Manifesto (1925) declared that the
“HRA stood for abolition of all systems which made
exploitation of man by man possible”. The HRA’s main organ
Revolutionary had proposed nationalisation of railways and
other means of transport and of heavy industries such as ship
building and steel. The HRA had also decided to start labour
and peasant organisations and work for an “organised and
armed revolution”. During their last days (late 1920s), these
revolutionaries had started moving away from individual
heroic action and violence towards mass politics.
Bismil, during his last days, appealed to the youth to
give up pistols and revolvers, not to work in revolutionary
conspiracies and instead work in an open movement. He
urged the youth to strengthen Hindu-Muslim unity, unite all
political groups under the leadership of the Congress. Bismil
affirmed faith in communism and the principle that “every
human being has equal rights over the products of nature”.
The famous statement of the revolutionary position is
contained in the book The Philosophy of the Bomb written
by Bhagwaticharan Vohra.
Even before his arrest, Bhagat Singh had moved away
from a belief in violent and individual heroic action to
Marxism and the belief that a popular broad-based movement
alone could lead to a successful revolution. In other words,
revolution could only be “by the masses, for the masses”.
That is why Bhagat Singh helped establish the Punjab
Naujawan Bharat Sabha (1926) as an open wing of
revolutionaries to carry out political work among the youth,
peasants and workers, and it was to open branches in villages.
Bhagat and Sukhdev also organised the Lahore Students’
Union for open, legal work among students. Bhagat and his
comrades also realised that a revolution meant organisation
and development of a mass movement of the exploited and
the suppressed sections by the revolutionary intelligentsia.
Bhagat used to say, “...real revolutionary armies are in villages
and factories.”
What then was the need for individual heroic action?

Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, ...

 355

Firstly, effective acquisition of new ideology is a prolonged
and historical process whereas the need of the time was a
quick change in the way of thinking. Secondly, these young
intellectuals faced the classic dilemma of how to mobilise
people and recruit them. Here, they decided to opt for
propaganda by deed, i.e., through individual heroic action and
by using courts as a forum for revolutionary propaganda.
Redefining Revolution
Revolution was no longer equated with militancy and violence.
Its objective was to be national liberation—imperialism was
to be overthrown but beyond that a new socialist order was
to be achieved, ending “exploitation of man by man”. As
Bhagat Singh said in the court, “Revolution does not
necessarily involve sanguinary strife, nor is there a place in
it for personal vendetta. It is not the cult of bomb and pistol.
By revolution we mean the present order of things, which
is based on manifest injustice, must change.”
Bhagat fully accepted Marxism and the class approach
to society—”Peasants have to free themselves not only from
the foreign yoke, but also from the yoke of landlords and
capitalists.” He also said, “The struggle in India will continue,
so long as a handful of exploiters continue to exploit labour
of common people to further their own interests. It matters
little whether these exploiters are British capitalists, British
and Indian capitalists in alliance, or even purely Indians.” He
defined socialism scientifically as abolition of capitalism and
class domination.
Bhagat was fully and consciously secular—two of the
six rules drafted by Bhagat for the Punjab Naujawan Bharat
Sabha were that its members would have nothing to do with
communal bodies and that they would propagate a general
feeling of tolerance among people, considering religion to
be a matter of personal belief. Bhagat Singh also saw the
importance of freeing people from the mental bondage of
religion and superstition—”to be a revolutionary, one required
immense moral strength, but one also required criticism and
independent thinking”.

Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  357

Chapter 18

Simon Commission and
the Nehru Report
Appointment of the Indian
Statutory Commission
The Government of India Act, 1919 had a provision that a
commission would be appointed ten years from date to study
the progress of the governance scheme and suggest new
steps. An all-white, seven-member Indian Statutory
Commission, popularly known as the Simon Commission
(after the name of its chairman, Sir John Simon), was set
up by the British government under Stanley Baldwin’s prime
ministership on November 8, 1927. The commission was to
recommend to the British government whether India was
ready for further constitutional reforms and along what lines.
Although constitutional reforms were due only in 1929,
the Conservative government, then in power in Britain, feared
defeat by the Labour Party and thus did not want to leave
the question of the future of Britain’s most priced colony
in “irresponsible Labour hands”. Also by the mid-1920s, the
failure of the 1919 Act to create a stable imperial power
had led to several parliamentary reports and inquiries. The
Lee Commission went into the Raj’s failure to recruit enough
British officers; the Mudiman Commission looked into the
deadlock within the diarchic dispensation; and the Linlithgow
Commission inquired into the crisis of Indian agriculture. So
357

358  

the British government thought it necessary to go more fully
into the working of the 1919 Act. The Conservative Secretary
of State for India, Lord Birkenhead, who had constantly talked
of the inability of Indians to formulate a concrete scheme
of constitutional reforms which had the support of wide
sections of Indian political opinion, was responsible for the
appointment of the Simon Commission.

Indian Response

The Indian response to the Simon Commission was immediate
and nearly unanimous. What angered the Indians most was
the exclusion of Indians from the commission and the basic
notion behind the exclusion that foreigners would discuss and
decide upon India’s fitness for self-government. This notion
was seen as a violation of the principle of self-determination,
and as a deliberate insult to the self-respect of Indians.
Congress Response
The Congress session in Madras (December 1927) meeting
under the presidency of M.A. Ansari decided to boycott the
commission “at every stage and in every form”. Meanwhile
Nehru succeeded in getting a snap resolution passed at the
session, declaring complete independence as the goal of the
Congress.
Other Groups
Those who decided to support the Congress call of boycott
of the Simon Commission included the liberals of the Hindu
Mahasabha and the majority faction of the Muslim League
under Jinnah. The Muslim league had two sessions in 1927
– one under Jinnah at Calcutta where it was decided to oppose
the Simon Commission, and another at Lahore under
Muhammad Shafi, who supported the government. Some
others, such as the Unionists in Punjab and the Justice Party
in the south, decided not to boycott the commission.
Public Response
The commission landed in Bombay on February 3, 1928. On
that day, a countrywide hartal was organised and mass rallies
held. Wherever the commission went, there were black flag
demonstrations, hartals and slogans of ‘Simon Go Back’.
A significant feature of this upsurge was that a new
generation of youth got their first taste of political action.

Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  359

Dr Ambedkar and the Simon Commission
Dr Ambedkar was appointed by the Bombay Legislative Council to
work with the Simon Commission. In October 1928, Ambedkar went
before the commission.
He argued for ‘universal adult franchise’ for both male and
female alike; for provincial autonomy in the provinces and dyrarchy
at Centre. (Significantly, universal adult franchise was at the time
yet to be guaranteed in most of European countries.)
On behalf of the Bahishkrita Hitakarini Sabha, he submitted
a memorandum on the rights and safeguards he felt were required
for the depressed classes.
Ambedkar said that there was no link between the depressed
classes and the Hindu community, and stated that the depressed
classes should be regarded as a distinct and independent minority.
He asserted that the depressed classes as a minority needed
far greater political protection than any other minority in British India
because of its educational backwardness, its economically poor
condition, its social enslavement, and for the reason that it suffered
from certain grave political disabilities, from which no other
community suffered.
In the circumstances, Dr Ambedkar demanded, for the political
protection of the depressed classes, representation on the same
basis as the Mohammedan minority. He wanted reserved seats for
the depressed classes if universal adult franchise was granted. In
case universal franchise was not granted, Ambedkar said he would
campaign for a separate electorate for the depressed classes.
He also expressed the need to have certain safeguards either
in the constitution, if it was possible, or else “in the way of advice
in the instrument to the governor regarding the education of the
depressed classes and their entry into the public services”.
[The report of the Simon Commission did grant reserved seats
to the depressed classes, but the condition was that candidates
who would take part in the elections would have, first of all, to
get their competence endorsed by the governor of the province.
Ambedkar was most displeased with this but, in any case, this
report remained a dead letter.]

They played the most active part in the protest, giving it a
militant flavour. The youth leagues and conferences got a real
fillip.
Nehru and Subhash Bose emerged as leaders of this
new wave of youth and students. Both travelled extensively,
addressed and presided over conferences.

360  

This upsurge among the youth also provided a fertile
ground for the germination and spread of new radical ideas
of socialism reflected in the emergence of groups such as
the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Workers’ and Peasants’
Parties and Hindustani Sewa Dal (Karnataka).

Police Repression

The police came down heavily on demonstrators; there were
lathicharges not sparing even the senior leaders. Jawaharlal
Nehru and G.B. Pant were beaten up in Lucknow. Lala Lajpat
Rai received severe blows on his chest in October 1928
which proved fatal and he died on November 17, 1928.
View
The blows, which fell on me today, are the last nails driven
into the coffin of British Imperialism.
—Lala Lajpat Rai

Impact of Appointment of Simon
Commission on the National Movement

The impact of the appointment of the Simon Commission
on Indian politics was two-fold:
(i) It gave a stimulus to radical forces demanding not
just complete independence but major socio-economic
reforms on socialist lines. When the Simon Commission was
announced, the Congress, which did not have any active
programme in hand, got an issue on which it could once again
forge mass action.
(ii) The challenge of Lord Birkenhead to Indian
politicians to produce an agreed constitution was accepted
by various political sections, and thus prospects for Indian
unity seemed bright at that point of time.

The Simon Commission Recommendations

The Simon Commission published a two-volume report in
May 1930. It proposed the abolition of dyarchy and the
establishment of representative government in the provinces
which should be given autonomy. It said that the governor
should have discretionary power in relation to internal
security and administrative powers to protect the different
communities. The number of members of provincial legislative
council should be increased.

Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  361

The report rejected parliamentary responsibility at the
centre. The governor-general was to have complete power to
appoint the members of the cabinet. And the Government of
India would have complete control over the high court.
It also recommended that separate communal electorates
be retained (and extended such electorates to other
communities) but only until tensions between Hindus and
Muslims had died down. There was to be no universal
franchise.
It accepted the idea of federalism but not in the near
future; it suggested that a Consultative Council of Greater
India should be established which should include
representatives of both the British provinces as well as
princely states.
It suggested that the North-West Frontier Province and
Baluchistan should get local legislatures, and both NWFP and
Baluchistan should have the right to be represented at the
centre.
It recommended that Sindh should be separated from
Bombay, and Burma should be separated from India because
it was not a natural part of the Indian subcontinent.
It also suggested that the Indian army should be
Indianised though British forces must be retained. India got
fully equipped.
But by the time the report came out, it was no longer
relevant because several events overtook the importance of
its recommendations.

Nehru Report
As an answer to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, an All Parties
Conference met in February 1928 and appointed a subcommittee under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru to draft
a constitution. This was the first major attempt by the Indians
to draft a constitutional framework for the country. The
committee included Tej Bahadur Sapru, Subhash Bose, M.S.
Aney, Mangal Singh, Ali Imam, Shuab Qureshi and G.R.
Pradhan as its members. The report was finalised by August
1928. The recommendations of the Nehru Committee were
unanimous except in one respect—while the majority favoured
the “dominion status” as the basis of the Constitution, a
section of it wanted “complete independence” as the basis,

362  

with the majority section giving the latter section liberty of
action.

Main Recommendations

The Nehru Report confined itself to British India, as it
envisaged the future link-up of British India with the princely
states on a federal basis. For the dominion it recommended:
(i) Dominion status on lines of self-governing dominions
as the form of government desired by Indians (much to the
chagrin of younger, militant section—Nehru being prominent
among them).
(ii) Rejection of separate electorates which had been
the basis of constitutional reforms so far; instead, a demand
for joint electorates with reservation of seats for Muslims
at the Centre and in provinces where they were in minority
(and not in those where Muslims were in majority, such as
Punjab and Bengal) in proportion to the Muslim population
there with right to contest additional seats.
(iii) Linguistic provinces.
(iv) Nineteen fundamental rights including equal rights
for women, right to form unions, and universal adult suffrage.
(v) Responsible government at the Centre and in provinces—
(a) The Indian Parliament at the Centre to consist of
a 500-member House of Representatives elected on the basis
of adult suffrage, a 200-member Senate to be elected by
provincial councils; the House of Representatives to have a
tenure of 5 years and the Senate, one of 7 years; the central
government to be headed by a governor-general, appointed
by the British government but paid out of Indian revenues,
who would act on the advice of the central executive council
responsible to the Parliament.
(b) Provincial councils to have a 5-year tenure, headed
by a governor acting on the advice of the provincial executive
council.
(vi) Full protection to cultural and religious interests
of Muslims.
(vii) Complete dissociation of State from religion.

The Muslim and Hindu Communal
Responses

Though the process of drafting a constitutional framework
was begun enthusiastically and unitedly by political leaders,

Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  363

communal differences crept in and the Nehru Report got
involved in controversies over the issue of communal
representation.
Delhi Proposals of Muslim League
Earlier, in December 1927, a large number of Muslim leaders
had met at Delhi at the Muslim League session and evolved
four proposals for their demands to be incorporated into the
draft constitution. These proposals, which were accepted by
the Madras session of the Congress (December 1927), came
to be known as the ‘Delhi Proposals’. These were:
● joint electorates in place of separate electorates with
reserved seats for Muslims;
● one-third representation to Muslims in Central
Legislative Assembly;
● representation to Muslims in Punjab and Bengal in
proportion to their population;
● formation of three new Muslim majority provinces—
Sindh, Baluchistan and North-West Frontier Province.
Hindu Mahasabha Demands
The Hindu Mahasabha was vehemently opposed to the proposals
for creating new Muslim-majority provinces and reservation
of seats for Muslims majorities in Punjab and Bengal (which
would ensure Muslim control over legislatures in both). It
also demanded a strictly unitary structure. This attitude of
the Hindu Mahasabha complicated matters.
Compromises
In the course of the deliberations of the All Parties
Conference, the Muslim League dissociated itself and stuck
to its demand for reservation of seats for Muslims, especially
in the central legislature and in Muslim majority provinces.
Thus, Motilal Nehru and other leaders drafting the report
found themselves in a dilemma: if the demands of the Muslim
communal opinion were accepted, the Hindu communalists
would withdraw their support, if the latter were satisfied, the
Muslim leaders would get estranged.
The concessions made in the Nehru Report to Hindu
communalists included the following:
● Joint electorates proposed everywhere but reservation
for Muslims only where in minority;

364  
● Sindh to be detached from Bombay only after
dominion status was granted and subject to weightage given
to Hindu minority in Sindh;
● Political structure proposed broadly unitary, as
residual powers rested with the centre.

Amendments Proposed by Jinnah

At the All Parties Conference held at Calcutta in December
1928 to consider the Nehru Report, Jinnah, on behalf of the
Muslim League, proposed three amendments to the report:
(i) one-third representation to Muslims in the central
legislature;
(ii) reservation to Muslims in Bengal and Punjab
legislatures proportionate to their population, till
adult suffrage was established; and
(iii) residual powers to provinces.
These demands were not accommodated.
Jinnah’s Fourteen Points
Jinnah went back to the Shafi faction of the Muslim League
and in March 1929 gave fourteen points which were to
become the basis of all future propaganda of the Muslim
League. The fourteen points were as follows.
1. Federal Constitution with residual powers to
provinces.
2. Provincial autonomy.
3. No constitutional amendment by the centre without
the concurrence of the states constituting the Indian federation.
4. All legislatures and elected bodies to have adequate
representation of Muslims in every province without reducing
a majority of Muslims in a province to a minority or equality.
5. Adequate representation to Muslims in the services
and in self-governing bodies.
6. One-third Muslim representation in the central
legislature.
7. In any cabinet at the centre or in the provinces, onethird to be Muslims.
8. Separate electorates.
9. No bill or resolution in any legislature to be passed
if three-fourths of a minority community consider such a bill
or resolution to be against their interests.

Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  365

10. Any territorial redistribution not to affect the
Muslim majority in Punjab, Bengal and NWFP.
11. Separation of Sindh from Bombay.
12. Constitutional reforms in the NWFP and
Baluchistan.
13. Full religious freedom to all communities.
14. Protection of Muslim rights in religion, culture,
education and language.

Nehru Report Found Unsatisfactory

Not only were the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha and
the Sikh communalists unhappy about the Nehru Report, but
the younger section of the Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru
and Subhash Bose were also angered. The younger section
regarded the idea of dominion status in the report as a step
backward, and the developments at the All Parties Conference
strengthened their criticism of the dominion status idea.
Nehru and Subhash Bose rejected the Congress’ modified
goal and jointly set up the Independence for India League.

The Run-up to Civil
Disobedience Movement
Calcutta Session of Congress

It was at the Calcutta session of the Congress in December
1928 that the Nehru Report was approved but the younger
elements led by Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Bose and
Satyamurthy expressed their dissatisfaction with dominion
status as the goal of Congress. Instead, they demanded that
the Congress adopt purna swaraj or complete independence
as its goal. The older leaders like Gandhi and Motilal Nehru
wished that the dominion status demand not be dropped in
haste, as consensus over it had been developed with great
difficulty over the years. They suggested that a two-year grace
period be given to the government to accept the demand for
a dominion status. Later, under pressure from the younger
elements, this period was reduced to one year. Now, the
Congress decided that if the government did not accept a
constitution based on dominion status by the end of the year,
the Congress would not only demand complete independence
but would also launch a civil disobedience movement to attain
its goal.

Political Activity during 1929

Gandhi travelled incessantly during 1929 preparing people
for direct political action—telling the youth to prepare for
the fiery ordeal, helping to organise constructive work in
villages and redressing specific grievances (on lines of the
Bardoli agitation of 1928).
The Congress Working Committee (CWC) organised
a Foreign Cloth Boycott Committee to propagate an aggressive
programme of boycotting foreign cloth and public burning
of foreign cloth. Gandhi initiated the campaign in March
1929 in Calcutta and was arrested. This was followed by
bonfires of foreign cloth all over the country.
Other developments which kept the political temperature
high during 1929 included the Meerut Conspiracy Case
(March), bomb explosion in Central Legislative Assembly by
Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt (April) and the coming to power
of the minority Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald
in England in May. And Wedgewood Benn became the
Secretary of State for India.

Irwin’s Declaration (October 31, 1929)

Before the Simon Commission report came out, the
declaration by Lord Irwin was made. It was the combined
effort of the Labour government (always more sympathetic
to Indian aspirations than the Conservatives) and a Conservative
viceroy. The purpose behind the declaration was to “restore
faith in the ultimate purpose of British policy”. The declaration
was made in the form of an official communique in the Indian
Gazette on October 31, 1929. It said:
“In view of the doubts which have been expressed both
in Great Britain and in India regarding the interpretations to
be placed on the intentions of the British government in
enacting the statute of 1919, I am authorised on behalf of
His Majesty’s Government to state clearly that in their
judgement it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 that the
natural issue of India’s constitutional progress as they
contemplated is the attainment of Dominion status.”
However, there was no time scale. The dominion status
promised by Irwin would not be available for a long time
to come. There was in reality nothing new or revolutionary
in the declaration.

368  

Lord Irwin also promised a Round Table Conference
after the Simon Commission submitted its report.

Delhi Manifesto

On November 2, 1929, a conference of prominent national
leaders issued a ‘Delhi Manifesto’ which put forward certain
conditions for attending the Round Table Conference:
1. that the purpose of the Round Table Conference
should be not to determine whether or when dominion
status was to be reached but to formulate a constitution
for implementation of the dominion status (thus
acting as a constituent assembly) and the basic
principle of dominion status should be immediately
accepted;
2. that the Congress should have majority representation
at the conference; and
3. there should be a general amnesty for political
prisoners and a policy of conciliation;
Gandhi along with Motilal Nehru and other political
leaders met Lord Irwin in December 1929 (after the viceroy
had narrowly escaped after a bomb was detonated meaning
to hit the train he was travelling in). They asked the viceroy
for assurance that the purpose of the round table conference
was to draft a constitutional scheme for dominion status. That
was not the purpose of the conference, said Irwin. Viceroy
Irwin rejected the demands put forward in the Delhi Manifesto.
The stage for confrontation was to begin now.

Lahore Congress and Purna Swaraj

Jawaharlal Nehru, who had done more than anyone else to
popularise the concept of purna swaraj, was nominated the
president for the Lahore session of the Congress (December
1929) mainly due to Gandhi’s backing (15 out of 18
Provincial Congress Committees had opposed Nehru). Nehru
was chosen
— because of the appositeness of the occasion
(Congress’ acceptance of complete independence
as its goal), and
— to acknowledge the upsurge of youth which had
made the anti-Simon campaign a huge success.
Nehru declared in his presidential address, “We have

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 369

now an open conspiracy to free this country from foreign
rule and you, comrades, and all our countrymen and countrywomen are invited to join it.”
Further explaining that liberation did not mean only
throwing off the foreign yoke, he said: “I must frankly
confess that I am a socialist and a republican, and am no
believer in kings and princes, or in the order which produces
the modern kings of industry, who have greater power of the
lives and fortunes of men than even the kings of old, and
whose methods are as predatory as those of the old feudal
aristocracy.”
Spelling out the methods of struggle, he said, “Any
great movement for liberation today must necessarily be a
mass movement, and mass movements must essentially be
peaceful, except in times of organised revolt...”
The following major decisions were taken at the Lahore
session.
●
The Round Table Conference was to be boycotted.
●
Complete independence was declared as the aim of
the Congress.
●
Congress Working Committee was authorised to
launch a programme of civil disobedience including
non-payment of taxes and all members of legislatures
were asked to resign their seats.
●
January 26, 1930 was fixed as the first Independence
(Swarajya) Day, to be celebrated everywhere.
December 31, 1929
At midnight on the banks of River Ravi, the newly adopted
tricolour flag of freedom was hoisted by Jawaharlal Nehru
amidst slogans of Inquilab Zindabad.

January 26, 1930: the Independence
Pledge

Public meetings were organised all over the country in
villages and towns and the independence pledge was read out
in local languages and the national flag was hoisted. This
pledge, which is supposed to have been drafted by Gandhi,
made the following points:
● It is the inalienable right of Indians to have freedom.
● The British Government in India has not only deprived

370  

us of freedom and exploited us, but has also ruined us
economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. India
must therefore sever the British connection and attain purna
swaraj or complete independence.
● We are being economically ruined by high revenue,
destruction of village industries with no substitutions made,
while customs, currency and exchange rate are manipulated
to our disadvantage.
● No real political powers are given—rights of free
association are denied to us and all administrative talent in
us is killed.
● Culturally, the system of education has torn us from
our moorings.
● Spiritually, compulsory disarmament has made us
unmanly.
● We hold it a crime against man and God to submit
any longer to British rule.
● We will prepare for complete independence by
withdrawing, as far as possible, all voluntary association from
the British government and will prepare for civil disobedience
through non-payment of taxes. By this an end of this inhuman
rule is assured.
● We will carry out the Congress instructions for
purpose of establishing purna swaraj.

Civil Disobedience Movement—
the Salt Satyagraha and Other
Upsurges
Gandhi’s Eleven Demands

To carry forward the mandate given by the Lahore Congress,
Gandhi presented eleven demands to the government and gave
an ultimatum of January 31, 1930 to accept or reject these
demands. The demands were as follows.
Issues of General Interest
1. Reduce expenditure on Army and civil services by
50 per cent.
2. Introduce total prohibition.

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 371

3. Carry out reforms in Criminal Investigation
Department (CID).
4. Change Arms Act allowing popular control of issue
of firearms licences.
5. Release political prisoners.
6. Accept Postal Reservation Bill.
Specific Bourgeois Demands
7. Reduce rupee-sterling exchange ratio to 1s 4d
8. Introduce textile protection.
9. Reserve coastal shipping for Indians.
Specific Peasant Demands
10. Reduce land revenue by 50 per cent.
11. Abolish salt tax and government’s salt monopoly.
With no positive response forthcoming from the
government on these demands, the Congress Working
Committee invested Gandhi with full powers to launch the
Civil Disobedience Movement at a time and place of his
choice. By February-end, Gandhi had decided to make salt
the central formula for the movement

Why Salt was Chosen as the
Important Theme

As Gandhi said, “There is no other article like salt,
outside water, by taxing which the government can reach the
starving millions, the sick, the maimed and the utterly
helpless... it is the most inhuman poll tax the ingenuity of
man can devise.”
Salt in a flash linked the ideal of swaraj with a most
concrete and universal grievance of the rural poor (and with
no socially divisive implications like a no-rent campaign).
Salt afforded a very small but psychologically important
income, like khadi, for the poor through self-help.
Like khadi, again, it offered to the urban populace the
opportunity of a symbolic identification with mass suffering.

Dandi March (March 12-April 6, 1930)

On March 2, 1930, Gandhi informed the viceroy of his plan
of action. According to this plan (few realised its significance
when it was first announced), Gandhi, along with a band of
seventy-eight members of Sabarmati Ashram, was to march

372  

from his headquarters in Ahmedabad through the villages of
Gujarat for 240 miles. On reaching the coast at Dandi, the
salt law was to be violated by collecting salt from the beach.
Even before the proposed march began, thousands
thronged to the ashram. Gandhi gave the following directions
for future action.
● Wherever possible civil disobedience of the salt law
should be started.
● Foreign liquor and cloth shops can be picketed.
● We can refuse to pay taxes if we have the requisite
strength.
● Lawyers can give up practice.
● Public can boycott law courts by refraining from
litigation.
● Government servants can resign from their posts.
● All these should be subject to one condition—truth
and non-violence as means to attain swaraj should
be faithfully adhered to.
● Local leaders should be obeyed after Gandhi’s
arrest.
The historic march, marking the launch of the Civil
Disobedience Movement, began on March 12, and Gandhi
broke the salt law by picking up a lump of salt at Dandi on
April 6. The violation of the law was seen as a symbol of
the Indian people’s resolve not to live under British-made
laws and therefore under British rule. Gandhi openly asked
the people to make salt from sea water in their homes and
violate the salt law. The march, its progress and its impact
on the people was well covered by newspapers. In Gujarat,
300 village officials resigned in answer to Gandhi’s appeal.
Congress workers engaged themselves in grassroot level
organisational tasks.

Spread of Salt Law Disobedience

Once the way was cleared by Gandhi’s ritual at Dandi,
defiance of the salt laws started all over the country. Nehru’s
arrest in April 1930 for defiance of the salt law evoked huge
demonstrations in Madras, Calcutta and Karachi. Gandhi’s
arrest came on May 4, 1930 when he had announced that
he would lead a raid on Dharasana Salt Works on the west

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 373

coast. Gandhi’s arrest was followed by massive protests in
Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and in Sholapur, where the response
was the most fierce. After Gandhi’s arrest, the CWC
sanctioned:
● non-payment of revenue in ryotwari areas;
● no-chowkidara-tax campaign in zamindari areas; and
● violation of forest laws in the Central Provinces.
Satyagraha at Different Places
A brief survey of the nature of Civil Disobedience Movement
in different parts of the subcontinent is given below.
● Tamil Nadu In April 1930, C. Rajagopalachari
organised a march from Thiruchirapalli (Trichinapoly as it
was called by the British) to Vedaranniyam on the Tanjore
(or Thanjavur) coast to break the salt law. The event was
followed by widespread picketing of foreign cloth shops; the
anti-liquor campaign gathered forceful support in interior
regions of Coimbatore, Madura, Virdhanagar, etc. Although,
Rajaji tried to keep the movement non-violent, violent
eruptions of masses and the violent repressions of the police
began. To break the Choolai mills strike, police force was
used. Unemployed weavers attacked liquor shops and police
pickets at Gudiyattam, while the peasants, suffering from
falling prices, rioted at Bodinayakanur in Madura.
● Malabar K. Kelappan, a Nair Congress leader famed
for the Vaikom Satyagraha, organised salt marches. P.
Krishna Pillai, the future founder of the Kerala Communist
movement, heroically defended the national flag in the face
of police lathi-charge on Calicut beach in November 1930.
● Andhra Region District salt marches were organised
in east and west Godavari, Krishna and Guntur. A number of
sibirams (military style camps) were set up to serve as the
headquarters of the Salt Satyagraha. The merchants contributed
to Congress funds, and the dominant caste Kamma and Raju
cultivators defied repressive measures. But the mass support
like that in the non-cooperation movement (1921-22) was
missing in the region.
● Orissa Under Gopalbandhu Chaudhuri, a Gandhian
leader, salt satyagraha proved effective in the coastal regions
of Balasore, Cuttack and Puri districts.

374  
● Assam The civil disobedience failed to regain the
heights attained in 1921-22 due to divisive issues: the
growing conflicts between Assamese and Bengalis, Hindus
and Muslims, and the tensions developing from the inflow
of Muslim peasants from the densely populated east Bengal.
However, a successful student strike against the Cunningham
Circular, which banned students’ participation in politics, was
seen in May 1930. Chandraprabha Saikiani, in December
1930, incited the aboriginal Kachari villages to break forest
laws, which was, however, denied by the Assam Congress
leadership.
● Bengal The Bengal Congress, divided into two
factions led by Subhas Bose and J.M. Sengupta, was involved
in the Calcutta Corporation election. This resulted in alienation
of most of Calcutta bhadralok leaders from the rural masses.
Also, communal riots were seen in Dacca (now Dhakha) and
Kishoreganj, and there was little participation of Muslims in
the movements. Despite this, Bengal provided the largest
number of arrests as well as the highest amount of violence.
Midnapur, Arambagh and several rural pockets witnessed
powerful movements developed around salt satyagraha and
chaukidari tax. During the same period, Surya Sen’s Chittagong
revolt group carried out a raid on two armouries and declared
the establishment of a provisional government.
● Bihar Champaran and Saran were the first two
districts to start salt satyagraha. In landlocked Bihar,
manufacture of salt on a large scale was not practicable and
at most places it was a mere gesture. In Patna, Nakhas Pond
was chosen as a site to make salt and break the salt law under
Ambika Kant Sinha. However, very soon, a very powerful nochaukidari tax agitation replaced the salt satyagraha (owing
to physical constraints in making salt). By November 1930,
sale of foreign cloth and liquor dramatically declined, and
administration collapsed in several parts like the Barhee
region of Munger.
The tribal belt of Chhotanagpur (now in Jharkhand), saw
instances of lower-class militancy. Bonga Majhi and Somra
Majhi, influenced by Gandhism, led a movement in Hazaribagh
which combined socio-religious reform along ‘sanskritising’

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 375

lines, in which followers were asked to give up meat and
liquor, and use khadi. However, the Santhals were reported
to be taking up illegal distillation of liquor on a large scale
under the banner of Gandhi! It was observed that while most
big zamindars remained loyal to the government, small
landlords and better-off tenants participated in the movement.
But several times, increased lower-class-militancy lowered
the enthusiasm of the small landlords and better-off tenants.
Peshawar Here, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan’s educational
and social reform work among the Pathans had politicised
them. Gaffar Khan, also called Badshah Khan and Frontier
Gandhi, had started the first Pushto political monthly
Pukhtoon and had organised a volunteer brigade ‘Khudai
Khidmatgars’, popularly known as the ‘Red-Shirts’, who were
pledged to the freedom struggle and non-violence.
On April 23, 1930, the arrest of Congress leaders in
the NWFP led to mass demonstrations in Peshawar which
was virtually in the hands of the crowds for more than a week
till order was restored on May 4. This was followed by a
reign of terror and martial law. It was here that a section
of Garhwal Rifles soldiers refused to fire on an unarmed
crowd. This upsurge in a province with 92 per cent Muslim
population left the British government nervous.
Sholapur This industrial town of southern Maharashtra
saw the fiercest response to Gandhi’s arrest. Textile workers
went on a strike from May 7 and along with other residents
burnt liquor shops and other symbols of government authority
such as railway stations, police stations, municipal buildings,
law courts, etc. The activists established a virtual parallel
government which could only be dislodged with martial law
after May 16.
Dharasana On May 21, 1930, Sarojini Naidu, Imam
Sahib and Manilal (Gandhi’s son) took up the unfinished task
of leading a raid on the Dharasana Salt Works. The unarmed
and peaceful crowd was met with a brutal lathicharge which
left 2 dead and 320 injured. This new form of salt satyagraha
was eagerly adopted by people in Wadala (Bombay), Karnataka
(Sanikatta Salt Works), Andhra, Midnapore, Balasore, Puri
and Cuttack.

376  

Gujarat The impact was felt in Anand, Borsad and
Nadiad areas in Kheda district, Bardoli in Surat district and
Jambusar in Bharuch district. A determined no-tax movement
was organised here which included refusal to pay land
revenue. Villagers crossed the border into neighbouring
princely states (such as Baroda) with their families and
belongings and camped in the open for months to evade
police repression. The police retaliated by destroying their
property and confiscating their land.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Central Provinces These
areas saw defiance of forest laws such as grazing and timber
restrictions and public sale of illegally acquired forest
produce.
United Provinces A no-revenue campaign was
organised; a call was given to zamindars to refuse to pay
revenue to the government. Under a no-rent campaign, a call
was given to tenants against zamindars. Since most of the
zamindars were loyalists, the campaign became virtually a norent campaign. The activity picked up speed in October 1930,
especially in Agra and Rai Bareilly.
Manipur and Nagaland These areas took a brave part
in the movement. At the young age of thirteen, Rani
Gaidinliu, a Naga spiritual leader, who followed her cousin
Haipou Jadonang, born in what is now the state of Manipur,
raised the banner of revolt against foreign rule. “We are free
people, the white men should not rule over us,” she declared.
She urged the people not to pay taxes or work for the
British—in the tradition established by the freedom struggle

in the rest of India. As the reformist religious movement
steadily turned political, the British authorities caught Haipou
Jadonang and hanged him on charges of treason in 1931. A
manhunt was launched for Rani Gaidinliu. She outwitted the
British till October 1932 when she was finally captured. She
was later sentenced to life imprisonment. [It was the Interim
Government of India set up in 1946 that finally ordered her
release from Tura jail.]
Forms of Mobilisation
Mobilisation of masses was also carried out through prabhat
pheries, vanar senas, manjari senas, secret patrikas and
magic lantern shows.

Impact of Agitation

1. Imports of foreign cloth and other items fell.
2. Government suffered a loss of income from liquor,
excise and land revenue.
3. Elections to Legislative Assembly were largely
boycotted.

Extent of Mass Participation

Several sections of the population participated in the Civil
Disobedience Movement.
Women Gandhi had specially asked women to play a
leading part in the movement. Soon, they became a familiar
sight, picketing outside liquor shops, opium dens and shops
selling foreign cloth. For Indian women, the movement was
the most liberating experience and can truly be said to have
marked their entry into the public sphere.
Students Along with women, students and youth played
the most prominent part in the boycott of foreign cloth and
liquor.
Muslims The Muslim participation was nowhere near
the 1920-22 level because of appeals by Muslim leaders to
stay away from the movement and because of active
government encouragement to communal dissension. Still,
some areas such as the NWFP saw an overwhelming
participation. Middle class Muslim participation was quite
significant in Senhatta, Tripura, Gaibandha, Bagura and
Noakhali. In Dacca, Muslim leaders, shopkeepers, lower class
people and upper class women were active. The Muslim

378  

weaving community in Bihar, Delhi and Lucknow were also
effectively mobilised.
Merchants and Petty Traders They were very
enthusiastic. Traders’ associations and commercial bodies
were active in implementing the boycott, especially in Tamil
Nadu and Punjab.
Tribals Tribals were active participants in Central
Provinces, Maharashtra and Karnataka.
Workers The workers participated in Bombay, Calcutta,
Madras, Sholapur, etc.
Peasants were active in the United Provinces, Bihar
and Gujarat.

Government Response—Efforts for Truce

The government’s attitude throughout 1930 was ambivalent
as it was puzzled and perplexed. It faced the classic dilemma
of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’, if force was
applied, the Congress cried ‘repression’, and if little action
taken, the Congress cried ‘victory’. Either way, the government
suffered an erosion of power. Even Gandhi’s arrest came
after much vacillation. But once the repression began, the
ordinances banning civil liberties were freely used, including
the press being gagged. Provincial governments were given
freedom to ban civil disobedience organisations. The Congress
Working Committee was, however, not declared illegal till
June. There were lathi charges and firing on unarmed crowds
which left several killed and wounded, while thousands of
satyagrahis besides Gandhi and other Congress leaders were
imprisoned.
The government repression and publication of the
Simon Commission Report, which contained no mention of
dominion status and was in other ways also a regressive
document, further upset even moderate political opinion.
In July 1930 the viceroy, Lord Irwin, suggested a round
table conference and reiterated the goal of dominion status.
He also accepted the suggestion that Tej Bahadur Sapru and
M.R. Jayakar be allowed to explore the possibility of peace
between the Congress and the government.
In August 1930 Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru were
taken to Yeravada Jail to meet Gandhi and discuss the

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 379

possibility of a settlement. The Nehrus and Gandhi
unequivocally reiterated the demands of:
1. right of secession from Britain;
2. complete national government with control over
defence and finance; and
3. an independent tribunal to settle Britain’s financial
claims.
Talks broke down at this point.

Gandhi-Irwin Pact

On January 25, 1931, Gandhi and all other members of the
Congress Working Committee (CWC) were released
unconditionally. The CWC authorised Gandhi to initiate
discussions with the viceroy. As a result of these discussions,
a pact was signed between the viceroy, representing the
British Indian Government, and Gandhi, representing the
Indian people, in Delhi on February 14, 1931. This Delhi
Pact, also known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, placed the
Congress on an equal footing with the government.
Irwin on behalf of the government agreed on—
1. immediate release of all political prisoners not
convicted of violence;
2. remission of all fines not yet collected;
3. return of all lands not yet sold to third parties;
4. lenient treatment to those government servants who
had resigned;
5. right to make salt in coastal villages for personal
consumption (not for sale);
6. right to peaceful and non-aggressive picketing; and
7. withdrawal of emergency ordinances.
The viceroy, however, turned down two of Gandhi’s
demands—
(i) public inquiry into police excesses, and
(ii) commutation of Bhagat Singh and his comrades’
death sentence to life sentence.
Gandhi on behalf of the Congress agreed—
(i) to suspend the civil disobedience movement, and
(ii) to participate in the next Round Table Conference
on the constitutional question around the three
lynch-pins of federation, Indian responsibility, and

380  

reservations and safeguards that may be necessary
in India’s interests (covering such areas as defence,
external affairs, position of minorities, financial
credit of India and discharge of other obligations).

Evaluation of Civil Disobedience Movement
Was Gandhi-Irwin Pact a Retreat?
Gandhi’s decision to suspend the civil disobedience movement
as agreed under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was not a retreat,
because:
(i) mass movements are necessarily short-lived;
(ii) capacity of the masses to make sacrifices, unlike
that of the activists, is limited; and
(iii) there were signs of exhaustion after September
1930, especially among shopkeepers and merchants,
who had participated so enthusiastically.
No doubt, youth were disappointed: they had participated
enthusiastically and wanted the world to end with a bang and
not with a whimper. Peasants of Gujarat were disappointed
because their lands were not restored immediately (indeed,
they were restored only during the rule of the Congress
ministry in the province). But many people were jubilant that
the government had been made to regard their movement as
significant and treat their leader as an equal, and sign a pact
with him. The political prisoners, when released from jails,
were given a hero’s welcome.
Comparison to Non-Cooperation Movement
There were certain aspects in which the Civil Disobedience
Movement differed from the Non-Cooperation Movement.
1. The stated objective this time was complete
independence and not just remedying two specific wrongs and
a vaguely-worded swaraj.
2. The methods involved violation of law from the very
beginning and not just non-cooperation with foreign rule.
3. There was a decline in forms of protests involving
the intelligentsia, such as lawyers giving up practice, students
giving up government schools to join national schools and
colleges.
4. Muslim participation was nowhere near that in the
Non-Cooperation Movement level.

Karachi Congress Session—1931
In March 1931, a special session of the Congress was held
at Karachi to endorse the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. Six days before
the session (which was held on March 29) Bhagat Singh,
Sukhdev and Rajguru were executed. Throughout Gandhi’s
route to Karachi, he was greeted with black flag demonstrations
by the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, in protest against his
failure to secure commutation of the death sentence for
Bhagat and his comrades.

Congress Resolutions at Karachi

● While disapproving of and dissociating itself from
political violence, the Congress admired the ‘bravery’ and
‘sacrifice’ of the three martyrs.
● The Delhi Pact or Gandhi-Irwin Pact was endorsed.
● The goal of purna swaraj was reiterated.
● Two resolutions were adopted—one on Fundamental
Rights and the other on National Economic Programme—
which made the session particularly memorable. The
Resolution on Fundamental Rights guaranteed—
* free speech and free press
* right to form associations

382  

*
*
*
*
*
*

right to assemble
universal adult franchise
equal legal rights irrespective of caste, creed and sex
neutrality of state in religious matters
free and compulsory primary education
protection to culture, language, script of minorities
and linguistic groups
The Resolution on National Economic Programme
included—
* substantial reduction in rent and revenue in the case
of landholders and peasants
* exemption from rent for uneconomic holdings
* relief from agricultural indebtedness
* control of usury
* better conditions of work including a living wage,
limited hours of work and protection of women
workers in the industrial sector
* right to workers and peasants to form unions
* state ownership and control of key industries, mines
and means of transport
This was the first time the Congress spelt out what
swaraj would mean for the masses—”in order to end
exploitation of masses, political freedom must include
economic freedom of starving millions.”
The Karachi Resolution was to remain, in essence, the
basic political and economic programme of the Congress in
later years.

The Round Table Conferences
The Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, and the Prime Minister
of Britain, Ramsay MacDonald, agreed that a round table
conference should be held, as the recommendations of the
Simon Commission report were clearly inadequate.

First Round Table Conference

The first Round Table Conference was held in London
between November 1930 and January 1931. It was opened
officially by King George V on November 12, 1930 and
chaired by Ramsay MacDonald.

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 383

This was the first conference arranged between the
British and the Indians as equals.
The Congress and some prominent business leaders
refused to attend, but many other groups of Indians were
represented at the conference.
The Indian princely states were represented by the
Maharaja of Alwar, Maharaja of Baroda, Nawab of Bhopal,
Maharaja of Bikaner, Rana of Dholpur, Maharaja of Jammu
and Kashmir, Maharaja of Nawanagar, Maharaja of Patiala

Chief Sahib of Sangli, Sir Prabhashankar Pattani (Bhavnagar),
Manubhai Mehta (Baroda), Sardar Sahibzada Sultan Ahmed
Khan (Gwalior), Akbar Hydari (Hyderabad), Mirza Ismail
(Mysore), Col. Kailas Narain Haksar (Jammu and Kashmir).
The Muslim League sent Aga Khan III (leader of BritishIndian delegation), Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Muhammad
Shafi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Zafarullah Khan,
A.K. Fazlul Huq, Hafiz Ghulam Hussain Hidayat Ullah,
Dr.Shafa’at Ahmad Khan, Raja Sher Muhammad Khan of
Domeli and A.H. Ghuznavi. The Hindu Mahasabha and its
sympathisers were represented by B.S. Moonje, M.R. Jayakar
and Diwan Bahadur Raja Narendra Nath. The Sikhs were
represented by Sardar Ujjal Singh and Sardar Sampuran Singh.

Burma, the Sindh and some other provinces.
The Government of India was represented by Narendra

384  

Nath Law, Bhupendra Nath Mitra, C.P. Ramaswami Iyer and
M. Ramachandra Rao.
Outcome Nothing much was achieved at the conference.
It was generally agreed that India was to develop into a
federation, there were to be safeguards regarding defence and
finance, while other departments were to be transferred. But
little was done to implement these recommendations and
civil disobedience continued in India.
The British government realised that the participation
of the Indian National Congress was necessary in any
discussion on the future of constitutional government in
India.

Second Round Table Conference

Members of the Indian Liberal Party such as Tej Bahadur
Sapru, C.Y. Chintamani and Srinivasa Sastri appealed to
Gandhi to talk with the Viceroy. Gandhi and Irwin reached
a compromise which came to be called the Gandhi-Irwin Pact
(the Delhi Pact).
The second Round Table Conference was held in
London from September 7, 1931 to December 1, 1931.
The Indian National Congress nominated Gandhi as
its sole representative. A. Rangaswami Iyengar and Madan
Mohan Malaviya were also there.
There were a large number of Indian participants,
besides the Congress.
The princely states were represented by Maharaja of
Alwar, Maharaja of Baroda, Nawab of Bhopal, Maharaja of
Bikaner, Maharao of Kutch, Rana of Dholpur, Maharaja of
Indore, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja of
Kapurthala, Maharaja of Nawanagar, Maharaja of Patiala,

Nath. The Liberals at the conference were J. N. Basu, C.Y.
Chintamani, Tej Bahadur Sapru, V.S. Srinivasa Sastri and
Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad. The Justice Party sent Raja of
Bobbili, Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, Sir A.P. Patro and
Bhaskarrao Vithojirao Jadhav. The Depressed Classes were
represented by B.R. Ambedkar and Rettamalai Srinivasan.
Sardar Ujjal Singh and Sardar Sampuran Singh represented
the Sikhs. The Parsis were represented by Cowasji Jehangir,
Homi Mody and Phiroze Sethna. Indian Christians were
represented by Surendra Kumar Datta and A.T. Pannirselvam.
Industry was represented by Ghanshyam Das Birla, Sir
Purshottamdas Thakurdas and Maneckji Dadabhoy. Labour
was represented by N. M. Joshi, B. Shiva Rao and V. V. Giri.
The representatives for Indian women were Sarojini Naidu,
Begum Jahanara Shahnawaz and Radhabai Subbarayan. The
universities were represented by Syed Sultan Ahmed and
Bisheshwar Dayal Seth. Representatives of Burma and from
the provinces of Sindh, Assam, Central Provinces and the
NWFP also attended.
The Government of India was represented by C.P.
Ramaswami Iyer, Narendra Nath Law and M. Ramachandra
Rao. Not much was expected from the conference because
of the following reasons.
● By this time, Lord Irwin had been replaced by Lord
Willingdon as viceroy in India. Just before the conference
began, the Labour government in England had been replaced
by a National Government which was an uneasy coalition
between Labour and Conservatives. The British were also
angered by the increased revolutionary activities which had
claimed many European lives in India.
● The Right Wing or Conservatives in Britain led by
Churchill strongly objected to the British government
negotiating with the Congress on an equal basis. They,

386  

instead, demanded a strong government in India. The Prime
Minister, Ramsay MacDonald headed the Conservativedominated cabinet with a weak and reactionary secretary of
state for India, Samuel Hoare.
● At the conference, Gandhi (and therefore the Congress)
claimed to represent all people of India against imperialism.
The other delegates, however, did not share this view.
Historians point out that many of the delegates were
conservative, government loyalists, and communalists, and
these groups were used by the colonial government to
neutralise the efforts of Gandhi. Because of the participation
of a large number of groups, the British government claimed
that the Congress did not represent the interests of all of
India.
● Gandhi pointed out that there was a need of a
partnership between Britain and India on the basis of equality.
He put forward the demand for the immediate establishment
of a responsible government at the centre as well as in the
provinces. He also reiterated that the Congress alone
represented political India. Saying that the untouchables were
Hindus, and thus not to be treated as a minority, he discarded
the idea of a separate electorate for them. He also said there
was no need for separate electorates or special safeguards
for Muslims or other minorities. Many of the other delegates
disagreed with Gandhi.
● The session soon got deadlocked on the question of
the minorities. Separate electorates were being demanded by
the Muslims, depressed classes, Christians and Anglo-Indians.
All these came together in a ‘Minorities’ Pact’. Gandhi fought
desperately against this concerted move to make all
constitutional progress conditional on the solving of this
issue.
● The princes were also not too enthusiastic about a
federation, especially after the possibility of the formation
of a Congress government at the centre had receded after
the suspension of civil disobedience movement.
Outcome The lack of agreement among the many
delegate groups meant that no substantial results regarding
India’s constitutional future would come out of the conference.
The session ended with MacDonald’s announcement of:

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 387

(i) two Mulsim majority provinces—North-West
Frontier Province (NWFP) and Sindh;
(ii) the setting up of an Indian Consultative Committee;
(iii) setting up of three expert committees—finance,
franchise and states; and
(iv) the prospect of a unilateral British Communal
Award if Indians failed to agree.
The government refused to concede the basic Indian
demand of freedom. Gandhi returned to India on December
28, 1931.

Third Round Table Conference

The third Round Table Conference, held between November
17, 1932 and December 24, 1932, was not attended by the
Indian National Congress and Gandhi. It was ignored by most
other Indian leaders.
The Indian States were represented by Akbar Hydari
(Dewan of Hyderabad), Mirza Ismail (Dewan of Mysore),
V.T. Krishnamachari (Dewan of Baroda), Wajahat Hussain
(Jammu and Kashmir), Sir Sukhdeo Prasad (Udaipur, Jaipur,
Jodhpur), J.A. Surve (Kolhapur), Raja Oudh Narain Bisarya
(Bhopal), Manubhai Mehta (Bikaner), Nawab Liaqat Hayat
Khan (Patiala), Fateh Naseeb Khan (Alwar State), L.F.
Rushbrook Williams (Nawanagar), and Raja of Sarila (small
states). Other Indian representatives were Aga Khan III, B.R.
Ambedkar, Ramakrishna Ranga Rao of Bobbili, Sir Hubert
Carr, Nanak Chand Pandit, A.H. Ghuznavi, Henry Gidney,
Hafiz Hidayat Hussain, Muhammad Iqbal, M.R. Jayakar,
Cowasji Jehangir, N.M. Joshi, Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar,
Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, Begum Jahanara Shahnawaz,
A.P. Patro, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Dr.Shafa’at Ahmad Khan, Sir
Shadi Lal, Tara Singh Malhotra, Sir Nripendra Nath Sircar,
Sir Purshottamdas Thakurdas, Muhammad Zafarullah Khan.
Again, like in the two previous conferences, little was
achieved. The recommendations were published in a White
Paper in March 1933 and debated in the British Parliament
afterwards. A Joint Select Committee was formed to analyse
the recommendations and formulate a new Act for India, and
that committee produced a draft Bill in February 1935 which
was enforced as the Government of India Act of 1935 in
July 1935.

388  

Civil Disobedience Resumed
On the failure of the second Round Table Conference, the
Congress Working Committee decided on December 29,
1931 to resume the civil disobedience movement.

During Truce Period
(March-December 1931)

Some activity during the period March to December 1931
kept alive the spirit of defiance. In the United Provinces, the
Congress had been leading a movement for rent reduction
and against summary evictions. In the NWFP, severe repression
had been unleashed against the Khudai Khidmatgars and the
peasants led by them who were agitating against the brutal
methods of tax-collection by the government. In Bengal,
draconian ordinances and mass detentions had been used in
the name of fighting terrorism. In September 1931, there was
a firing incident on political prisoners in Hijli Jail.

Changed Government Attitude After
Second RTC

The higher British officials had drawn their own lessons from
the Delhi Pact which they thought had raised the political
prestige of the Congress and the political morale of the
people and had undermined British prestige. After the second
Round Table Conference, the British were determined to
reverse this trend. There were three main considerations in
British policy:
1. Gandhi would not be permitted to build up the tempo
for a mass movement again.
2. Goodwill of the Congress was not required, but the
confidence of those who supported the British against the
Congress—government functionaries, loyalists, etc.—was
very essential.
3. The national movement would not be allowed to
consolidate itself in rural areas.
After the CWC decided to resume the civil disobedience movement, Viceroy Willingdon refused a meeting
with Gandhi on December 31. On January 4, 1932, Gandhi
was arrested.

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 389

Government Action

A series of repressive ordinances were issued which ushered
in a virtual martial law, though under civilian control, or a
‘Civil Martial Law’. Congress organisations at all levels were
banned; arrests were made of activists, leaders, sympathisers;
properties were confiscated; Gandhi ashrams were occupied.
Repression was particularly harsh on women. Press was
gagged and nationalist literature, banned.

Popular Response

People responded with anger. Though unprepared, the response
was massive. In the first four months alone, about 80,000
satyagrahis, mostly urban and rural poor, were jailed. Other
forms of protest included picketing of shops selling liquor
and foreign cloth, illegal gatherings, non-violent
demonstrations, celebrations of national days, symbolic
hoistings of national flag, non-payment of chowkidara tax,
salt satyagraha, forest law violations and installation of a
secret radio transmitter near Bombay. This phase of the civil
disobedience movement coincided with upsurges in two
princely states—Kashmir and Alwar. But this phase of the
movement could not be sustained for long because
(i) Gandhi and other leaders had no time to build up
the tempo; and
(ii) the masses were not prepared.
Finally in April 1934, Gandhi decided to withdraw the
civil disobedience movement. Though people had been cowed
down by superior force, they had not lost political faith in
the Congress—they had won freedom in their hearts.

Communal Award and
Poona Pact
The Communal Award was announced by the British prime
minister, Ramsay MacDonald, on August 16, 1932. The
Communal Award, based on the findings of the Indian
Franchise Committee (also called the Lothian Committee),
established separate electorates and reserved seats for
minorities, including the depressed classes which were
granted seventy-eight reserved seats. Thus, this award accorded

390  

separate electorates for Muslims, Europeans, Sikhs, Indian
Christians, Anglo-Indians, depressed classes, and even to the
Marathas for some seats in Bombay. The award was perceived
by the national leaders led by the Congress as another
manifestation of the British policy of divide and rule.
It should be noted here that Dr B.R. Ambedkar in the
past, in his testimony to the Simon Commission, had stressed
that the depressed classes should be treated as a distinct,
independent minority separate from the caste Hindus. Even,
the Bengal Depressed Classes Association had lobbied for
separate electorates with seats reserved according to the
proportion of depressed class members to the total population
as well as for adult franchise. But the Simon Commission
rejected the proposal of separate electorate for the depressed
classes; however, it retained the concept of reserving seats.
In the second Round Table Conference held in London,
Ambedkar again raised the issue of separate electorate for
the depressed classes. Earlier in the conference, Ambedkar
had attempted to compromise with Gandhi on reserved seats
in a common electorate, but Gandhi, who had declared
himself the sole representative of India’s oppressed masses,
rejected Ambedkar’s proposal, and denounced the other
delegates as unrepresentative. Further, Gandhi attempted to
strike a deal with Muslims, promising to support their
demands as long as the Muslims voted against separate
electorates for the depressed classes. It is argued that
political considerations might have motivated Gandhi to adopt
such a stand. But despite such efforts, a consensus on the
minority representation could not be worked out among the
Indian delegates. In the wake of such a situation, Ramsay
MacDonald, who had chaired the committee on minorities,
offered to mediate on the condition that the other members
of the committee supported his decision. And, the outcome
of this mediation was the Communal Award.

Main Provisions of the Communal Award

● Muslims, Europeans, Sikhs, Indian Christians, AngloIndians, depressed classes, women, and even the Marathas
were to get separate electorates. Such an arrangement for
the depressed classes was to be made for a period of 20
years.

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 391

● In the provincial legislatures, the seats were to be
distributed on communal basis.
● The existing seats of the provincial legislatures were
to be doubled.
● The Muslims, wherever they were in minority, were
to be granted a weightage.
● Except in the North West Frontier Province, 3 per
cent seats were to be reserved for women in all provinces.
● The depressed classes to be declared/accorded the
status of minority.
● The depressed classes were to get ‘double vote’, one
to be used through separate electorates and the other to be
used in the general electorates.
● Allocation of seats were to be made for labourers,
landlords, traders and industrialists.
● In the province of Bombay, 7 seats were to be
allocated for the Marathas.

Congress Stand

Though opposed to separate electorates, the Congress was
not in favour of changing the Communal Award without the
consent of the minorities. Thus, while strongly disagreeing
with the Communal Award, the Congress decided neither to
accept it nor to reject it.
The effort to separate the depressed classes from the
rest of the Hindus by treating them as separate political
entities was vehemently opposed by all the nationalists.

Gandhi’s Response

Gandhi saw the Communal Award as an attack on Indian unity
and nationalism. He thought it was harmful to both Hinduism
and to the depressed classes since it provided no answer to
the socially degraded position of the depressed classes. Once
the depressed classes were treated as a separate political
entity, he argued, the question of abolishing untouchability
would get undermined, while separate electorates would
ensure that the untouchables remained untouchables in
perpetuity. He said that what was required was not protection
of the so-called interests of the depressed classes but root
and branch eradication of untouchability.
Gandhi demanded that the depressed classes be elected

392  

through joint and if possible a wider electorate through
universal franchise, while expressing no objection to the
demand for a larger number of reserved seats. And to press
his demands, he went on an indefinite fast on September 20,
1932. Now leaders of various persuasions, including
B.R. Ambedkar, M.C. Rajah and Madan Mohan Malaviya got
together to hammer out a compromise contained in the Poona
Pact.

Poona Pact

Signed by B.R. Ambedkar on behalf of the depressed classes
on September 24, 1932, the Poona Pact abandoned the idea
of separate electorates for the depressed classes. But the
seats reserved for the depressed classes were increased from
71 to 147 in provincial legislatures and to 18 per cent of
the total in the Central Legislature.
The Poona Pact was accepted by the government as an
amendment to the Communal Award.

Impact of Poona Pact on Dalits

The Poona Pact, despite giving certain political rights to the
depressed classes, could not achieve the desired goal of
emancipation of the depressed class. It enabled the same old
Hindu social order to continue and gave birth to many
problems.
● The Pact made the depressed classes political tools
which could be used by the majoritarian caste Hindu
organisations.
● It made the depressed classes leaderless as the true
representatives of the classes were unable to win against the
stooges who were chosen and supported by the caste Hindu
organisations.
● This led to the depressed classes to submit to the
status quo in political, ideological and cultural fields and not
being able to develop independent and genuine leadership to
fight the Brahminical order.
● It subordinated the depressed classes into being part
of the Hindu social order by denying them a separate and
distinct existence.
● The Poona Pact perhaps put obstructions in the way
of an ideal society based on equality, liberty, fraternity and
justice.

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 393

● By denying to recognise the Dalits as a separate and
distinct element in the national life, it pre-empted the rights
and safeguards for the Dalits in the Constitution of independent
India.
Joint Electorates and Its Impact on
Depressed Classes
The Working Committee of the All India Scheduled Caste
Federation alleged that in the last elections held under the
Government of India Act, 1935, the system of joint electorates
deprived the scheduled castes of the right to send true and
effective representatives to the legislatures. The committee,
further, said that the provisions of the joint electorate gave
the Hindu majority the virtual right to nominate members of
the scheduled castes who were prepared to be the tools of
the Hindu majority. The working committee of the federation,
thus, demanded for the restoration of the system of separate
electorates, and nullification of the system of joint electorates
and reserved seats. Even after signing the Poona Pact, Dr
B.R. Ambedkar continued to denounce the Poona Pact till
1947.

Gandhi’s Harijan Campaign and
thoughts on Caste
Determined to undo the divisive intentions of the government’s
divide and rule policy, Gandhi gave up all his other
preoccupations and launched a whirlwind campaign against
untouchability—first from jail and then, after his release in
August 1933, from outside jail.
While in jail, he set up the All India Anti-Untouchability
League in September 1932 and started the weekly Harijan
in January 1933. After his release, he shifted to the Satyagraha
Ashram in Wardha as he had vowed in 1930 not to return
to Sabarmati Ashram unless swaraj was won.
Starting from Wardha, he conducted a Harijan tour of
the country in the period from November 1933 to July 1934,
covering 20,000 km, collecting money for his newly set up
Harijan Sevak Sangh, and propagating removal of untouchability
in all its forms. He urged political workers to go to villages

394  

and work for social, economic, political and cultural upliftment
of the Harijans. He undertook two fasts—on May 8 and
August 16, 1934—to convince his followers of the seriousness
of his effort and the importance of the issue. These fasts
created consternation in nationalist ranks throwing many into
an emotional crisis.
Throughout his campaign, Gandhi was attacked by
orthodox and reactionary elements. These elements disrupted
his meetings, held black flag demonstrations against him and
accused him of attacking Hinduism. They also offered
support to the government against the Congress and the Civil
Disobedience Movement. The government obliged them by
defeating the Temple Entry Bill in August 1934. Orthodox
Hindu opinion in Bengal was against the acceptance of
permanent caste Hindu minority status by the Poona
Pact.
Throughout his Harijan tour, social work and fasts,
Gandhi stressed on certain themes:
● He put forward a damning indictment of Hindu
society for the kind of oppression practised on Harijans.
● He called for total eradication of untouchability
symbolised by his plea to throw open temples to the
untouchables.
● He stressed the need for caste Hindus to do ‘penance’
for untold miseries inflicted on Harijans. For this reason he
was not hostile to his critics such as Ambedkar. He said,
“Hinduism dies if untouchability lives, untouchability has to
die if Hinduism is to live.”
● His entire campaign was based on principles of
humanism and reason. He said that the Shastras do not
sanction untouchability, and if they did, they should be
ignored as it was against human dignity.
Gandhi was not in favour of mixing up the issue of
removal of untouchability with that of inter-caste marriages
and inter-dining because he felt that such restrictions existed
among caste Hindus and among Harijans themselves, and
because the all-India campaign at the time was directed
against disabilities specific to Harijans.
Similarly, he distinguished between abolition of
untouchability and abolition of caste system as such. On this

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 395

point he differed from Ambedkar who advocated annihilation
of the caste system to remove untouchability. Gandhi felt
that whatever the limitations and defects of the varnashram
system, there was nothing sinful about it, as there was about
untouchability. Untouchability, Gandhi felt, was a product of
distinctions of high and low and not of the caste system itself.
If it could be purged of this distinction, the varnashram
could function in a such manner that each caste would be
complementary to the other rather than being higher or lower.
Anyway, he hoped that believers and critics of the caste
system would come together in the fight against untouchability.
He believed that the removal of untouchability would
have a positive impact on communal and other questions
since opposition to untouchability meant opposing the notion
of highness and lowness. He was opposed to using compulsion
against the orthodox Hindus whom he called ‘sanatanis’. They
were to be won over by persuasion, by appealing to “their
reason and their hearts”. His fasts were aimed at inspiring
friends and followers to redouble their work to abolish
untouchability.
Gandhi’s Harijan campaign included a programme of
internal reform by Harijans covering education, cleanliness,
hygiene, giving up eating of beef and carrion and consumption
of liquor, and removing untouchability among themselves.
Impact of the Campaign Gandhi repeatedly described
the campaign as not a political movement but as being
primarily meant to purify Hinduism and Hindu society.
Gradually, the campaign carried the message of nationalism
to Harijans who also happened to be the agricultural labourers
in most parts of the country, leading to their increasing
participation in the national and peasant movements.

Ideological Differences and
Similarities between Gandhi
and Ambedkar
Gandhi, the principal architect of the Indian freedom struggle,
and B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Constitution
of independent India, shared many ideas, though in many ways

396  

they held different beliefs. There is a striking similarity in
the symbolisim involved in some of the actions of both
individuals. The burning of foreign cloth by Gandhi and the
burning of Manusmriti by Ambedkar are not to be seen as
mere acts of sentiment. Rather, foreign cloth and Manusmriti
represented the bondage and slavery for India. So too, a pinch
of salt from the ocean, and a drop of water from the Mahad
tank were acts of political catharsis and social philosophy.
Gandhi believed that freedom was never to be bestowed
but to be wrested from the authority by the people who desire
it, whereas Ambedkar expected bestowing of freedom by the
imperial rulers.
The two leaders differed over the nature and scope of
democracy as a method of government. Ambedkar advocated
parliamentary system of government for independent India,
but Gandhi had very little respect for the parliamentary
system of governance. Gandhi believed that democracy tends
to get converted into mass democracy with a propensity for
domination by leaders. Ambedkar was inclined towards mass
democracy as it could act as a pressure on the government
with the advancement of the oppressed people.
As a political and social activist, Ambedkar had certain
principles which were very rigid, while Gandhi had no
rigidities of ideology or principles except the uncompromising
notion of non-violence. Gandhi tried to put forward simple
practical alternatives to the political streams of the twentieth
century like liberalism, communism and fascism. Ambedkar,
on the other hand, had a natural inclination for liberal
ideology and desired institutional framework and structures.
Ambedkar’s politics tended to highlight the aspect of Indian
disunity whereas the Gandhian politics tried to show the
aspect of Indian unity. In ‘Hind Swaraj’, Gandhi tries to
prove that India has always been a nation prior to the
beginning of the imperial rule and it was the British rule who
broke this cultural unity. Ambedkar, on the other hand,
believed in the notion that Indian unity was the by-product
of the legal system introduced by the imperial state.
For Gandhi, ‘Gramraj’ was ‘Ramraj’ and real
independence for Indians. But for Ambedkar, the status-quoist
nature of the Indian villages denied equality and fraternity
and also liberty. As the scourge of casteism and untouchability

CDM and Round Table Conferences

 397

was most dominant in the rural areas of India, Ambedkar
believed that ‘Gramraj’ would continue the social hierarchy
based on discrimination and inequality. So he vehemently
propagated that there was nothing to be of proud of the Indian
village system.
The idea of the use of compulsion or force for social
integration as well as social reforms was negated by Ambedkar.
But the idea of proper education to make the individual desire
for change, reform and integration was the stance where the
views of two leaders were the same.
The two leaders also differed in their views and
approaches in respect of the context of development for
deprived classes. For instance, when Gandhi named the
depressed classes and the untouchables as ‘Harijan’, Ambedkar
denounced it as a clever scheme. Thus, when the Depressed
Classes League was renamed as Harijan Sevak Sangh (by
Gandhi), Ambedkar left the organisation by claiming that for
Gandhi removal of untouchability was only a platform, not
a sincere programme.
Ambedkar held that the centre of religion must be
between man and man, and not between man and God alone,
as preached by Gandhi. In the beginning, Ambedkar too
wanted to cast away the evil practices prevalent in Hinduism
in an attempt to reform and reconstruct, rather than destroy
it fully. But in the later phase of his life, he left Hinduism,
denouncing it as an entity which couldn’t be reformed.
Ambedkar denounced the Vedas and other Hindu
scriptures. He believed that the Hindu scriptures do not lend
themselves to a unified and coherent understanding, and
reflect strong contradictions within and across sects. And the
caste system and untouchability were the manifestations of
the Hindu religious scriptures. On the contrary, Gandhi held
that caste system in Hinduism has nothing to do with
religious precepts and spirituality. For Gandhi, caste and
varna are different, and caste is perversive degeneration.
In political precepts, Ambedkar believed in freedom of
religion, free citizenship and separation of State and religion.
Gandhi also endorsed the idea of freedom of religion, but
never approved a separation of politics and religion. But
religion as an agent of social change was well accepted by
both leaders. Both denounced in theory and thinking anything

398  

that either decried or diminished the role of religion in the
life of an individual or in the life of society.
Ambedkar envisaged limited sovereign power of the
State and, following from that, limited authority for the
government. According him, legal sovereign power should be
limited and people should be the ultimate sovereign. Gandhi
too believed in limited sovereign power of the State.
According to him, absolute sovereign power of the State
would annihilate the spirit and personality of an individual.
Gandhi, in fact, believed in least governance being the best
governance.
The notions of violence and non-violence got differing
explanations from Gandhi and Ambedkar. Ambedkar held
absolute non-violence as an end and relative violence as a
means, whereas Gandhi never made such a distinction and
was an avowed opponent of violence of any kind.
Ambedkar believed in purity of ends and justified means
as just when the ends were just. Whereas in Gandhian
perception it was purity of means that determined the end.
Gandhi and Ambedkar differed greatly in their views
concerning mechanisation of production and utilisation of
heavy machinery. Gandhi was apprehensive about the dehumanising impact of mechanisation and held it responsible
for the creation as well as sustaining of exploitative socioeconomic orders in the world. Ambedkar, on the other hand,
attributed the evil effect of machinery to wrong social
organisations that gave sanctity to private property and the
pursuit of personal gains. Ambedkar was of the firm belief
that machinery and modern civilisation were of benefit to
all, and held that the slogan of a democratic society must
be machinery and more machinery, civilisation and more
civilisation.
The idea of social transformation through democratic
and peaceful means got support from Ambedkar as well as
View
It would thus appear that Ambedkar and Gandhi had common
allergy for social evil and imperial injustice. But a fundamental
difference, more apparent than real, demarcated the two minds.

Gandhi. They never sought a violent overthrow of any kind.
Ambedkar desisted from pleading a blunt destruction of the
social order, however, evil it was. And like Gandhi, he wanted
to solve the problem of social disharmony and disintegration
through peaceful rehabilitation of the oppressed classes.
The target groups of Ambedkar and Gandhi were
different, even though they converged at certain points. The
methods and skills of communication and mobilisation of
both were different. Gandhi spoke in plain local vernacular,
whereas Ambedkar spoke in English.
To disobey the law to make the law more just was a
Gandhian principle; its outward manifestations were noncooperation, hartal, satyagraha and civil disobedience.
Ambedkar was more inclined towards the observance of law
and constitutionality in the political process.
Gandhi viewed the untouchables as an integral part of
the Hindu whole, whereas Ambedkar had an ambivalent stand
on the issue. Ambedkar regarded the untouchables as a
religious minority and not a part of the Hindu community,
and preferred to call them a ‘political minority’ or ‘minority
by force’. To Gandhi, untouchability was one of the many
problems confronted by Indian society. To Ambedkar,
untouchability was the major problem that captured his sole
attention. Ambedkar made an exhaustive study of the problem
from its the historical angle, while Gandhi was more concerned
with the problem in its contemporary situation. Ambedkar
wanted to solve the problem of untouchability through laws
and constitutional methods, whereas Gandhi treated
untouchability as a moral stigma and wanted it to be erased
by acts of atonement. Gandhi had little use of legal/
constitutional modes; he looked to morality and thus supported
conscience to remedy the evil.

Debates on the Future
Strategy after Civil
Disobedience Movement
Following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement,
there was a two-stage debate on the future strategy of the
nationalists: the first stage was on what course the national
movement should take in the immediate future, i.e., during
the phase of non-mass struggle (1934-35); and the second
stage, in 1937, considered the question of office acceptance
in the context of provincial elections held under the autonomy
provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.

The First Stage Debate
Three perspectives were put forward on what the nationalists
should work on immediately after the end of the Civil
Disobedience Movement. The first two were traditional
responses, while the third one represented the rise of a strong
leftist trend within the Congress. The three perspectives were
as follows.
1. There should be constructive work on Gandhian lines.
2.There should be a constitutional struggle and
participation in elections to the Central Legislature (due in
1934) as advocated by M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai
Desai, S. Satyamurthy and B.C. Roy among others. They
argued that:
401

402  

in a period of political apathy, elections and council
work could be utilised to keep up the political
interest and morale of the people;
● participation in elections and council work did not
amount to faith in constitutional politics;
● another political front would help build up Congress
and prepare the masses for the next phase;
● this approach would give the Congress a certain
amount of prestige and confidence, and a strong
presence in councils would serve as an equivalent
to the movement.
3. A strong leftist trend within the Congress, represented
by Nehru, was critical of both constructive work and council
entry in place of the suspended civil disobedience movement
as that would sidetrack political mass action and divert
attention from the main issue of the struggle against
colonialism. Instead, this section favoured resumption and
continuation of non-constitutionalist mass struggle because
the situation was still revolutionary owing to continued
economic crisis and the readiness of the masses to fight.
●

Nehru’s Vision

Nehru said, “The basic goal before Indian people as before
people of the world is abolition of capitalism and establishment
of socialism.” He considered the withdrawal of the Civil
Disobedience Movement and council entry “a spiritual defeat”,
“a surrender of ideals” and “a retreat from revolutionary to
reformist mentality”.
He suggested that the vested interests be revised in
favour of the masses by taking up the economic and class
demands of peasants and workers, and landlords and capitalists,
organising masses in their class organisations—kisan sabhas
and trade unions. He argued that these class organisations
should be allowed to affiliate with the Congress, thus
influencing its policies and activities. There could be no
genuine anti-imperialist struggle, he said, without incorporating the class struggle of the masses.

Nehru’s Opposition to StruggleTruce-Struggle Strategy

A large number of Congressmen led by Gandhi believed that
a mass phase of movement (struggle phase) had to be

Debates on the Future Strategy after CDM

 403

followed by a phase of reprieve (truce phase) before the next
stage of mass struggle could be taken up. The truce period,
it was argued, would enable the masses to recoup their
strength to fight and also give the government a chance to
respond to the demands of the nationalists. The masses could
not go on sacrificing indefinitely. If the government did not
respond positively, the movement could be resumed again
with the participation of the masses. This was the struggletruce-struggle or S-T-S strategy.
Criticising the S-T-S strategy, Nehru argued that the
Indian national movement had reached a stage, after the
Lahore Congress call for purna swaraj programme, in which
there should be a continuous confrontation and conflict with
imperialism till it was overthrown. He advocated maintenance
of a “continuous direct action” policy by the Congress and
without the interposition of a constitutionalist phase. Real
power, he said, cannot be won by two annas and four annas.
Against an S-T-S strategy, he suggested a Struggle-Victory
(S-V) strategy.

Finally, Yes to Council Entry

Nationalists with apprehension and British officials with hope
expected a split in the Congress on Surat lines sooner or
later, but Gandhi conciliated the proponents of council entry
by acceding to their basic demand of permission to enter
the legislatures. He said, “Parliamentary politics cannot lead
to freedom but those Congressmen who could not, for some
reason, offer satyagraha or devote themselves to constructive
work should not remain unoccupied and could express their
patriotic energies through council work provided they are not
sucked into constitutionalism or self-serving.” Assuring the
leftists, Gandhi said that the withdrawal of the Civil
Disobedience Movement did not mean bowing down before
opportunists or compromising with imperialism.
In May 1934, the All India Congress Committee
(AICC) met at Patna to set up a Parliamentary Board to fight
elections under the aegis of the Congress itself.
Gandhi was aware that he was out of tune with powerful
trends in the Congress. A large section of the intelligentsia
favoured parliamentary politics with which he was in

404  

fundamental disagreement. Another section was estranged
from the Congress because of Gandhi’s emphasis on the
spinning wheel as the “second lung of the nation”. The
socialists led by Nehru also had differences with Gandhi. In
October 1934, Gandhi announced his resignation from the
Congress to serve it better in thought, word and deed. Nehru
and the socialists thought that the British must first be
expelled before the struggle for socialism could be waged,
and in an anti-imperialist struggle unity around the Congress,
still the only anti-imperialist mass organisation, was
indispensable. Thus it was better, they felt, to gradually
radicalise the Congress than to get isolated from the masses.
The right wing was no less accommodating. In the elections
to the Central Legislative Assembly held in November 1934,
the Congress captured 45 out of 75 seats reserved for
Indians.

Government of India Act, 1935
Amidst the struggle of 1932, the Third RTC was held in
November, again without Congress participation. The
discussions led to the formulation of the Act of 1935.

Main Features

The Government of India Act was passed by the British
Parliament in August 1935. Its main provisions were as
follows.
1. An All India Federation It was to comprise all
British Indian provinces, all chief commissioner’s provinces
and the Indian states (princely states). The federation’s
formation was conditional on the fulfilment of: (i) states with
allotment of 52 seats in the proposed Council of States
should agree to join the federation; and (ii) aggregate
population of states in the above category should be 50 per
cent of the total population of all Indian states.
Since these conditions were not fulfilled, the proposed
federation never came up. The central government carried on
upto 1946 as per the provisions of Government of India Act,
1919.
2. Federal Level: Executive ● The governor-general
was the pivot of the entire Constitution.

Debates on the Future Strategy after CDM

 405

● Subjects to be administered were divided into reserved
and transferred subjects. Reserved subjects—foreign affairs,
defence, tribal areas and ecclesiastical affairs—were to be
exclusively administered by the governor-general on the
advice of executive councillors. Executive councillors were
not to be responsible to the central legislature. Transferred
subjects included all other subjects and were to be administered
by the governor-general on the advice of ministers elected
by the legislature. These ministers were to be responsible
to the federal legislature and were to resign on losing the
confidence of the body.
● Governor-general could act in his individual judgement
in the discharge of his special responsibilities for the
security and tranquillity of India.
Legislature ● The bicameral legislature was to have an
upper house (Council of States) and a lower house (Federal
Assembly). The Council of States was to be a 260-member
house, partly directly elected from British Indian provinces
and partly (40 per cent) nominated by the princes. The
Federal Assembly was to be a 375-member house, partly
indirectly elected from British Indian provinces and partly
(one-third) nominated by the princes.
● Oddly enough, election to the Council of States was
direct and that to the Federal Assembly, indirect.
● Council of States was to be a permanent body with
one-third members retiring every third year. The duration of
the assembly was to be 5 years.
● The three lists for legislation purposes were to be
federal, provincial and concurrent.
● Members of Federal Assembly could move a vote
of no-confidence against ministers. Council of States could
not move a vote of no-confidence.
● The system of religion-based and class-based
electorates was further extended.
● 80 per cent of the budget was non-votable.
● Governor-general had residuary powers. He could
(a) restore cuts in grants, (b) certify bills rejected by the
legislature, (c) issue ordinances and (d) exercise his veto.
3. Provincial Autonomy ● Provincial autonomy
replaced dyarchy.

406  
● Provinces were granted autonomy and separate legal
identity.
● Provinces were freed from “the superintendence,
direction” of the secretary of state and governor-general.
Provinces henceforth derived their legal authority directly
from the British Crown.
● Provinces were given independent financial powers
and resources. Provincial governments could borrow money
on their own security.
Executive ● Governor was to be the Crown’s nominee
and representative to exercise authority on the king’s behalf
in a province.
● Governor was to have special powers regarding
minorities, rights of civil servants, law and order, British
business interests, partially excluded areas, princely states,
etc.
● Governor could take over and indefinitely run
administration.
Legislature ● Separate electorates based on Communal
Award were to be made operational.
● All members were to be directly elected. Franchise
was extended; women got the right on the same basis as men.
● Ministers were to administer all provincial subjects
in a council of ministers headed by a premier.
● Ministers were made answerable to and removable
by the adverse vote of the legislature.
● Provincial legislature could legislate on subjects in
provincial and concurrent lists.
● 40 per cent of the budget was still not votable.
● Governor could (a) refuse assent to a bill, (b)
promulgate ordinances, (c) enact governor’s Acts.

Evaluation of the Act

● Numerous ‘safeguards’ and ‘special responsibilities’
of the governor-general worked as brakes in the proper
functioning of the Act.
● In provinces, the governor still had extensive powers.
● The Act enfranchised 14 per cent of British Indian
population.
● The extension of the system of communal electorates

and representation of various interests promoted separatist
tendencies which culminated in partition of India.
● The Act provided a rigid constitution with no possibility
of internal growth. Right of amendment was reserved with
the British Parliament.
The Long-Term British Strategy ● Suppression could
only be a short-term tactic. In the long run, the strategy was
to weaken the national movement and integrate large segments
of the movement into colonial, constitutional and
administrative structure.
● Reforms would revive the political standing of
constitutionalist liberals and moderates who had lost public
support during the Civil Disobedience Movement.
● Repression earlier and reforms now would convince
a large section of Congressmen of the ineffectiveness of an
extra-legal struggle.
● Once Congressmen tasted power, they would be
reluctant to go back to politics of sacrifice.
● Reforms could be used to create dissensions within
Congress—right wing to be placated through constitutional
concessions and radical leftists to be crushed through police
measures.
● Provincial autonomy would create powerful provincial
leaders who would gradually become autonomous centres of
political power. Congress would thus be provincialised and
the central leadership would get weakened.

Nationalists’ Response

The 1935 Act was condemned by nearly all sections and
unanimously rejected by the Congress. The Hindu Mahasabha

408  

and the National Liberal Foundation, however, declared
themselves in favour of the working of the 1935 Act in the
central as well as at the provincial level. The Congress
demanded, instead, the convening of a Constituent Assembly
elected on the basis of adult franchise to frame a constitution
for independent India.

The Second Stage Debate
In early 1937, elections to provincial assemblies were
announced and once again the debate on the future strategy
to be adopted by the nationalists began.
Everyone in the Congress agreed that the 1935 Act was
to be opposed root and branch but it was not clear how it
was to be done in a period when a mass movement was not
yet possible. There was full agreement that the Congress
should fight these elections on the basis of a detailed
political and economic programme, thus deepening the antiimperialist consciousness of the people. But what to do after
the elections was not yet clear. If the Congress got majority
in a province, was it to agree to form a government?
There were sharp differences over these questions
among the nationalists. The two sides of the debate soon got
identified with the emerging ideological divide along the left
and right lines.

Divided Opinion

Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Bose, and Congress
socialists and communists were opposed to office acceptance
and thereby in the working of the 1935 Act because they
argued that it would negate the rejection of the Act by the
nationalists. It would be like assuming responsibility without
power. Also, it would take away the revolutionary character
of the movement as constitutional work would sidetrack the
main issues of freedom, economic and social justice, and
removal of poverty.
As a counter-strategy, the leftists proposed entry into
the councils with an aim to create deadlocks, thus making
the working of the Act impossible (older Swarajist strategy).
And, as a long-term strategy, they advocated an increased
reliance on workers and peasants, integration of their class
organisations into the Congress, thus imparting a socialist

Debates on the Future Strategy after CDM

 409

direction to the Congress and preparing for the resumption
of a mass movement.
The proponents of office acceptance argued that they
were equally committed to combating the 1935 Act, but work
in legislatures was to be only a short-term tactic since option
of a mass movement was not available at the time, and mass
struggle alone was capable of winning independence. Capture
or rejection of office was not a matter of socialism but of
strategy. They agreed that there was a danger of being sucked
in by wrong tendencies, but the answer was to fight these
tendencies and not to abandon office. The administrative field
should not be left open to pro-government reactionary forces.
Despite limited powers, provincial ministries could be used
to promote constructive work.

Gandhi’s Position

Gandhi opposed office acceptance in the CWC meetings but
by the beginning of 1936, he was willing to give a trial to
the formation of Congress ministries.
In its sessions at Lucknow in early 1936 and Faizpur
in late 1937, the Congress decided to fight elections and
postpone the decision on office acceptance to the postelection phase. The Congress resolution was “not to submit
to this constitution or to cooperate with it, but to combat
it both inside and outside the legislatures so that it can be
ended.” In February 1937, elections to the provincial
assemblies were held. Elections were held in eleven
provinces—Madras, Central Provinces, Bihar, Orissa, United
Provinces, Bombay Presidency, Assam, NWFP, Bengal, Punjab
and Sindh.
These elections were the first in which a larger number
of Indians than ever before were eligible to participate. An
estimated 30.1 million persons, including 4.25 million
women, had been enfranchised (14 per cent of the total
population), and 15.5 million of these, including 917,000
women, actually exercised their franchise, according to
reports.

Congress Manifesto for Elections

The Congress manifesto reaffirmed total rejection of the
1935 Act, and promised release of prisoners, removal of

410  

disabilities on the basis of gender and caste, radical
transformation of the agrarian system, substantial reduction
of rent and revenue, scaling down of rural debts, cheap credit
and right to form trade unions and to strike.
Gandhi did not attend a single election meeting.

Congress’ Performance

The Congress won 716 out of 1,161 seats it contested. (There
were 1,585 seats in the legislative assemblies of the eleven
provinces.) It got a majority in all provinces, except in
Bengal, Assam, Punjab, Sindh and the NWFP, and emerged
as the largest party in Bengal, Assam and the NWFP. Because
of this performance, the prestige of the Congress rose and
Nehru was reconciled to the dominant strategy of S-T-S.

Chapter 21

Congress Rule
in Provinces
Congress ministries were formed in Bombay, Madras, Central
Provinces, Orissa, United Provinces, Bihar and later in the
NWFP and Assam also.

Gandhi’s Advice
Gandhi advised Congressmen to hold these offices lightly and
not tightly. The offices were to be seen as ‘crowns of thorns’
which had been accepted to see if they quickened the pace
towards the nationalist goal. Gandhi advised that these offices
should be used in a way not expected or intended by the
British.
Gandhi urged Congressmen to prove that the Congress
could rule with least assistance from the police and the Army.

Work under Congress
Ministries
There was great enthusiasm among the people; suppressed
mass energy had got released. There was an increase in the
prestige of the Congress as it had showed that it could not
only lead people but could also use State power for their
benefit. But the Congress ministries had some basic
limitations: they could not, through their administration,
change the basic imperialist character of the system and
could not introduce a radical era.
411

412  

In the 28 months of Congress rule in the provinces,
there were some efforts made for people’s welfare.

Civil Liberties

The Congress ministries did much to ease curbs on civil
liberties:
● Laws giving emergency powers were repealed.
● Ban on illegal organisations, such as the Hindustan
Seva Dal and Youth Leagues, and on certain books and
journals was lifted.
● Press restrictions were lifted.
● Newspapers were taken out of black lists.
● Confiscated arms and arms licences were restored.
● Police powers were curbed and the CID stopped
shadowing politicians.
● Political prisoners and revolutionaries were released,
and deportation and internment orders were revoked.
● In Bombay lands confiscated by the government
during the Civil Disobedience Movement were restored.
● Pensions of officials associated with the Civil
Disobedience Movement were restored.
But there were certain blemishes in the performance
of the Congress ministries regarding civil liberties. Yusuf
Maherally, a socialist, was arrested by the Madras government
for inflammatory speeches and later released. S.S. Batliwala,
a socialist, was arrested by the Madras government for
seditious speech and given a six months’ sentence. Then,
K.M. Munshi, the Bombay home minister, used the CID
against communists and leftists.

Agrarian Reforms

There were certain basic constraints due to which the
Congress ministries could not undertake a complete overhaul
of the agrarian structure by completely abolishing zamindari.
These constraints were:
(i) The ministries did not have adequate powers.
(ii) There were inadequate financial resources as a
lion’s share was appropriated by the Government of India.
(iii) Strategy of class adjustments was another hurdle
since zamindars, etc., had to be conciliated and neutralised.
(iv) There was constraint of time since the logic of

Congress Rule in Provinces

 413

Congress politics was confrontation and not cooperation with
colonialism.
(v) War clouds had started hovering around 1938.
(vi) The reactionary second chamber (Legislative
Council) dominated by landlords, moneylenders and capitalists
in United Provinces, Bihar, Bombay, Madras and Assam had
to be conciliated as its support was necessary for legislations.
(vii) The agrarian structure was too complex.
In spite of these constraints, the Congress ministries
managed to legislate a number of laws relating to land
reforms, debt relief, forest grazing fee, arrears of rent, land
tenures, etc.
But most of these benefits went to statutory and
occupancy tenants while sub-tenants did not gain much.
Agricultural labourers did not benefit as they had not been
mobilised.

Attitude Towards Labour

The basic approach was to advance workers’ interests while
promoting industrial peace. This was sought to be achieved
by reducing strikes as far as possible and by advocating
compulsory arbitration prior to striking before the established
conciliation machinery. Goodwill was sought to be created
between labour and capital with mediation of ministries,
while at the same time efforts were made to improve
workers’ condition and secure wage increases for them.
The ministries treated militant trade union protests as
law and order problems, and acted as mediators as far as
possible. This approach was largely successful but not so in
Bombay. Also, leftist critics were not satisfied by this
approach. Generally, the ministries took recourse to Section
144 and arrested the leaders.
Nehru was unhappy about these repressive measures,
but in public supported the ministries to protect them from
petty and petulant criticism. Although Gandhi was against
militant and violent methods, he stood for political education
of the masses. He felt that the popular base of the Congress
should not erode. He appealed to Congressmen against
frequent resort to colonial laws and machinery.

414  

Social Welfare Reforms

These included the following—
● Prohibition imposed in certain areas.
● Measures for welfare of Harijans taken—temple
entry, use of public facilities, scholarships, an increase in
their numbers in government service and police, etc.
● Attention given to primary, technical and higher
education and to public health and sanitation.
● Encouragement given to khadi through subsidies and
other measures.
● Prison reforms undertaken.
● Encouragement given to indigenous enterprises.
● Efforts taken to develop planning through National
Planning Committee set up under Congress president Subhash
Bose in 1938.
Extra-Parliamentary Mass Activity of Congress
Such activities included—
●
launching of mass literacy campaigns,
●
setting up of Congress police stations and panchayats,
●
Congress Grievance Committees presenting mass
petitions to government, and
●
states peoples’ movements.

Evaluation
Though by 1939 internal strifes, opportunism and hunger for
power had started surfacing among Congressmen, yet they
were able to utilise council work to their advantage to a great
extent. The 28-month Congress rule was also significant for
the following reasons.
● The contention that Indian self-government was
necessary for radical social transformation got confirmed.
● Congressmen demonstrated that a movement could
use state power to further its ends without being co-opted.
● The ministries were able to control communal riots.
● The morale of the bureaucracy came down.
● Council work helped neutralise many erstwhile hostile
elements (landlords, etc).
● People were able to perceive the shape of things to
come if independence was won.

Congress Rule in Provinces

 415

● Administrative work by Indians further weakened the
myth that Indians were not fit to rule.
The Congress ministries resigned in October 1939
after the outbreak of the Second World War.
The huge Congress victory in the elections had aroused
the hopes of the industrial working class; there was increased
militancy and industrial unrest in Bombay, Gujarat, the United
Provinces and Bengal at a time when the Congress was drawn
into a closer friendship with Indian capitalists. This resulted
in what appeared to be an anti-labour shift in Congress
attitudes that led to the Bombay Traders Disputes Act in
1938. The Congress leadership was also faced with another
dilemma: how to react to the situation in the princely states—
should the Congress support the Prajamandal movement for
greater democracy or not.
In the meanwhile, the All India Muslim League, annoyed
with the Congress for not sharing power with them established
the Pirpur Committee in 1938 to prepare a detailed report
on the atrocities supposedly committed by the Congress
ministries. In its report the committee charged the Congress
with interference in the religious rites, suppression of Urdu
in favour of Hindi, denial of proper representation and of
the oppression of Muslims in the economic sphere.
The Congress was forced to realise that being in power
and actually running the administration was not easy, and all
sections of populations had such high expectations as could
not be fulfilled all at once.

Nationalist Response in
the Wake of World War II
Congress Crisis on Method of
Struggle
In the aftermath of the civil disobedience movement, there
was some disarray within the Congress. In Gandhi’s perception
there was rising corruption and indiscipline in the organisation.
He was also unhappy with the rivalries and petty squabbles
among the Congress leaders. There were issues of bogus
membership and unethical means employed in trying to
getting into the Congress committees and controlling them.
Gandhi firmly believed that the Congress should first put its
house in order before the movement could again be launched;
416

besides, he also felt the masses were not in the mood for
a struggle. There were others who felt that the struggle should
continue.

Haripura and Tripuri Sessions: Subhash
Bose’s Views

Subhash Chandra Bose was president of the Bengal Provincial
Congress Committee. His main area of work lay in the
organisation of the youth and promoting the trade union
movement. Subhash Bose did not agree with Gandhi and other
leaders of the Congress on many aspects of the struggle for
freedom. He along with Jawaharlal Nehru opposed the
Motilal Nehru Report which spoke for dominion status for
India. Bose was all for full independence; he also announced
the formation of the Independence League. When the Lahore
Congress session under Jawaharlal Nehru’s presidency adopted
a resolution that the Congress goal would be ‘Poorna Swaraj’,
Bose fully endorsed the decision. He was again fully active
in the Salt Satyagraha Movement in 1930, forcing the
government to arrest him. He was vehemently against the
suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and the
signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in 1931, especially as the
government refused to negotiate on the death sentence for
Bhagat Singh and his associates. From all this we get a clear
idea that Bose was a man of action and radical ideas.
Haripura
At the Congress meeting in Haripura, Gujarat, in February
1938, Bose was unanimously elected president of the session.
He was firm in his belief that the Congress ministries in the
provinces had immense revolutionary potential, as he said in
his presidential address. Bose also talked of economic
development of the country through planning and was
instrumental in setting up a National Planning Committee
later.
The session adopted a resolution that the Congress
would give moral support to those who were agitating against
the governance in the princely states.
In the following months, the international situation was
highly disturbed; there were clear signs that Europe was going
to be embroiled in war.

418  

1939: Subhash Wins but Congress
Faces Internal Strife
In January 1939, Subhash Bose decided to stand again for
the president’s post in the Congress. Gandhi was not happy
with Bose’s candidature. Bose said he represented the “new
ideas, ideologies, problems and programmes” that had come
out of the “the progressive sharpening of the anti-imperialist
struggle in India”. However, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad,
J.B. Kripalani and some other members of the Congress
Working Committee pointed out that it was in the various
Congress bodies, such as the working committee, that
ideologies and programmes were developed; moreover, the
position of the Congress president was more of a constitutional
one, representative and symbolic of the unity of the nation.
They favoured the candidate supported by Gandhi, namely,
Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Subhash Bose won the election by 1580
votes against 1377; he got the full support of the Congress
Socialist Party and the communists. Gandhi congratulated
Bose on his victory but also declared that “Pattabhi’s defeat
is my defeat.” Now it became a Gandhi versus Bose issue.
Tripuri
In March 1939 the Congress session took place at Tripuri,
in the Central Provinces (near Jabalpur in present Madhya
Pradesh). It was obvious that all was not well within the
Congress. The working committee, the ruling body of the
Congress, is not elected, but nominated by the president; the
election of the president is thus a constitutional opportunity
through which the membership expressed the nature of the
leadership of the Congress. With Bose’s victory the
polarisation in terms of ideology and method of future
struggle was clear. Thus the election of Bose, in the face
of the opposition of the official machine, led to a sharp inner
crisis.
Subhash Bose had accused the working committee
leaders of being ready to reach a compromise with the
government on the matter of federation. Now, those leaders
felt they could not work with a president who had publicly
cast doubts on their nationalistic principles and resigned from
the working committee.

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  419

Bose was ill when the Tripuri session took place, but
he attended it and in his presidential speech he prophecised
that an imperialist war was about to take place in Europe.
He declared: “In the first place, we must give clear and
unequivocal expression to what I have been feeling for some
time past, namely, that the time has come for us to raise
the issue of Swaraj and submit our national demand to the
British government in the form of an ultimatum...” He was
in favour of giving a six-month ultimatum to Britain to grant
the national demand of independence; if the ultimatum was
rejected, he said, a mass civil disobedience movement should
be launched.
In his opinion, as Bose was to write later, the Congress
was strong enough just as the masses were ready for such
a struggle. He felt that advantage should be taken of the
international crisis to strive for independence.
Gandhi, on the other hand, was firm in the belief that
it was not the time for such ultimatums as neither the
Congress nor the masses were yet ready for struggle. He was
also aware that there were communal discord and class strife
and a lack of unified vision and that this would undermine
any movement.
A resolution was moved by Govind Ballabh Pant,
reaffirming faith in Gandhian policies and asking Bose to
nominate the working committee “in accordance with the
wishes of Gandhiji”, and it was passed without opposition
from the socialists or the communists. Apparently, the Left
was not keen on discarding Gandhi’s leadership. However,
Gandhi said that he would not like to impose a working
committee on the president and that, since Bose was the
president, he should choose the members of the working
committee and lead the Congress.
Bose continued his effort to win Gandhi’s confidence
but did not succeed. Bose refused to nominate a new working
committee. Bose wanted an immediate struggle led by
Gandhi, whereas Gandhi was firm in his belief that the time
was not ripe for struggle. The problem was that ideologically
Gandhi and Bose were on different platforms. Gandhi was
not willing to lead a Congress struggle based on the radical
lines preferred by Bose, even as Bose was not willing to

420  

compromise on his ideas. Gandhi was of the view that he
would either lead the Congress on the basis of his own
strategy and style of politics or surrender the position of
the leader. In his reply to a letter from Bose, Gandhi wrote:
“The views you express seem to be so diametrically opposed
to those of the others and my own that I do not see any
possibility of bridging them.”
Bose had misjudged the support he had got in his
election. Even the socialists and the communists for the most
part were not keen on a split in the Congress. They realised
that a split would reduce the Left (which was not very
consolidated at the time) to a splinter group. They preferred
a united Congress led by Gandhi, as the national struggle was
of utmost importance and the Congress was at the time the
main organ of this struggle.
In the circumstances, Bose saw no option but to resign.
He resigned from the president’s post in April 1939. This
led to the election of Rajendra Prasad as president of the
Congress. The crisis in the Congress had been overcome for
the present.
In May, Bose and his followers formed the Forward
Bloc (at Makur, Unnao) as a new party within the Congress.
But when he gave a call for an all-India protest on July 9
against an AICC resolution, the Congress Working Committee
took disciplinary action against Bose: in August 1939, he was
removed from the post of president of the Bengal Provincial
Congress Committee besides being debarred from holding
any elective office in the Congress for a period of three
years.
Among the resolutions at Tripuri was an interesting one relating
to China: “The Congress sends its greetings to the people of China
and its deepest sympathy in their trials and privations in their
struggle against ruthless and inhuman imperialism. It congratulates
them on their heroic resistance.
“The Congress expresses its approval of the sending of a
Medical Mission on its behalf to the people of China and trusts
that this Mission will continue to receive full support, so that it
may carry on its work of succour effectively and be a worthy symbol
of Indian solidarity with China.”

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  421

Gandhi and Bose: Ideological
Differences
Gandhi and Subhash Bose had a deep respect for one another
despite their hugely differing ideologies. Each appreciated
the work done by the other in the national struggle for
freedom.
In 1942, Gandhi called Bose the “Prince among the
Patriots”. When the death of Bose was reported, Gandhi said
that Netaji’s “patriotism is second to none... His bravery
shines through all his actions. He aimed high and failed. But
who has not failed.” On another occasion Gandhi said, “Netaji
will remain immortal for all time to come for his service
to India.”
Bose was fully aware of Gandhi’s importance as a
symbol of Indian nationalism and called him “The Father of
Our Nation” in a radio broadcast from Rangoon in 1944 even
though in the same speech he expressed his own conviction
that force was the only way to win freedom from the British.
When forced to resign at the Tripuri session, Bose said he
would “yield to none in my respect for his (Gandhi’s)
personality”, adding that “it will be a tragic thing for me if
I succeed in winning the confidence of other people but fail
to win the confidence of India’s greatest man.” Later, Bose
said that the “service which Mahatma Gandhi has rendered
to India and to the cause of India’s freedom is so unique
and unparalleled that his name will be written in letters of
gold in our National History—for all time”.
Incidentally, both men considered socialism to be the
way forward in India, though in slightly different ways. Gandhi
did not subscribe to the Western form of socialism which
he associated with industrialisation, but agreed with the kind
of socialism advocated by Jayaprakash Narayan. Both Gandhi
and Bose were religious men and disliked communism. Both
worked against untouchability and spoke for women’s
emancipation. But they differed widely in their ways and
methods and in their political and economic ideologies.

Non-Violence versus Militant Approach

Gandhi was a firm believer in ahimsa and satyagraha, the nonviolent way to gain any goal. He believed that it was the way

422  

in which the masses could be involved. He objected to
violence firstly because an unarmed masses had little chance
of success in an armed rebellion, and then because he
considered violence a clumsy weapon which created more
problems than it solved, and left behind hatred and bitterness
which could not be overcome through reconciliation.
Bose believed that Gandhi’s strategy based on the
ideology of non-violence would be inadequate for securing
India’s independence. To his mind, violent resistance alone
could oust the alien imperialist rule from India. He considered
the Gandhian civil disobedience campaign as an effective
means of paralysing the administration, but did not think it
to be efficacious unless accompanied by a movement aimed
at total revolution that was prepared, if necessary, to use
violence.

Means and Ends

Bose had his eye on the result of the action. When war clouds
hung over Europe, he saw the situation as an opportunity to
take advantage of the British weakness. He believed in seizing
whatever opportunity was available to carry forward the
struggle for freedom. He openly criticised the British for
professing to fight for the freedom of the European nations
under Nazi control but refusing to grant independence to its
own colonies, including India. He had no compunction in
taking the help of the Nazis or the Fascists and later of
Imperial Japan—the ‘Axis powers’ as they came to be called
when the war broke out—even though he believed in freedom
and equality and other liberal ideals and disapproved of the
arrogant racialism of the Nazis and the suppression of
democratic institutions in Nazi Germany (as his writings
show). However, he admired the Nazis and the Fascists for
their discipline. Bose’s supporters point out that his
association with Germany and Japan was dictated by
revolutionary strategy and not by ideological kinship. In other
words, he was just a pragmatist; he was against the Fascist
theory of racial superiority and the Fascist acceptance of
capitalism.
Gandhi felt that the non-violent way of protest that he
propagated could not be practised unless the means and ends

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  423

were equally good. One could not just use any means to
achieve an end however desirable that end may be. It would
be against the truth that should guide one in all actions.
Besides, he had a deep dislike for the ideas of the Fascists
and the Nazis and would not think of using them to ally
against the British, especially when the latter were in a
difficult situation. He saw Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan
not just as aggressors but as dangerous powers. Gandhi
himself said: “The difference of outlook between him (Bose)
and me as to the means is too well known for comment.”
Bose acknowledged that Gandhi’s methods had their
importance when he said in his speech from Tokyo: “Though
personally I believe that this method will not succeed in
bringing us complete independence, there is no doubt that
it has greatly helped to rouse and unify the Indian people
and also to keep up a movement of resistance against the
foreign government.”

Form of Government

In his early writings, Bose expressed the opinion that
democracy was the acceptable political system for India. But
later, he seemed to have veered towards the idea that, at least
in the beginning, a democratic system would not be adequate
for the process of nation rebuilding and the eradication of
poverty and social inequality. In an address to students in
Tokyo University in 1944, Bose is quoted as saying: “You
cannot have a so-called democratic system, if that system
has to put through economic reforms on a socialistic basis.
Therefore we must have a political system—a State—of an
authoritarian character....”
[When Bose proclaimed, on October 21, 1943, the
formation of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind (Free
India), he held on to his post as Supreme Commander of the
Indian National Army, and also named himself head of state,
prime minister, and minister for war and foreign affairs. He
anticipated retaining the position of head of state in a free
India. This, say some scholars, indicated the authoritative
streak in Bose.]
As early as 1930, Bose expressed the opinion that in
India there should be “a synthesis of what modern Europe

424  

calls Socialism and Fascism. We have here the justice, the
equality, the love, which is the basis of Socialism, and
combined with that we have the efficiency and the discipline
of Fascism as it stands in Europe today.” He called this
‘samyavada’. Bose admired discipline and orderly approach
to anything. He admired these qualities in the Fascists of Italy
and in the Nazis of Germany. Indeed, it is clear from his
letters that, despite his dislike of colonial power and his
desire to oust the alien British rule from India, he was
impressed by the methodical and systematic approach of the
British and their disciplined way of life.
Bose, however, was not a Nazi or a Fascist, for he
supported empowerment of women, secularism and other
liberal ideas. Neither was Bose a communist: he considered
himself “a socialist, but that was a very different thing from
being a communist”. He laughed at the idea of internationalism
as espoused by the communists; he said nationalism was
important before going on to internationalism. He also felt
that the theoretical ideals found in Marx’s writings could not
be applied in India without a lot of modification. Nor did
he discard religion which was important to him. Bose was
a leftist in the sense that he was an anti-imperialist and
believed in attaining complete independence. After the
achievement of independence, Bose considered leftism would
mean socialism; the reconstruction of national life would
have to be on a socialist basis. Indeed, it would appear from
many of his writings that, after an initial stage of authoritarian
rule, there could be formed “a new India and a happy India
on the basis of the eternal principles of liberty, democracy
and socialism.”
Gandhi’s ideas on government can be found in the Hind
Swaraj (1909); it was “the nearest he came to producing a
sustained work of political theory.” Gandhi’s idealised state,
his Ramrajya—a utopia, in fact—did not need a representative
government, a constitution, an army or a police force.
Capitalism, communism, exploitation and religious violence
would be absent. Instead, the country was to be modelled on
the India of the past. In many ways, Gandhi’s writings call
for a pre-modern, morally-enlightened and apolitical Indian
state. Swaraj lays stress on self-governance through individuals

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  425

and community building. “At the individual level Swaraj is
vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate selfassessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing selfreliance.”
Gandhi said: “I look upon an increase in the power of
the state with greatest fear, because although while apparently
doing good by minimising exploitation, it does the greatest
harm to mankind by destroying individuality which is at the
root of progress”. He was sceptical of the party system and
sure that representative democracy could not provide people
with justice. He advocated a stateless society in which life
becomes perfect.
Gandhi was opposed to centralisation. He believed in
decentralisation of political as well as economic power, and
this could come about only by beginning from the basic unit.
In his vision of swaraj, society would be composed of
“innumerable… ever-widening, never-ascending” village
republics. The basic unit would be the village whose people
will always abide by the ideals of truth and non-violence.
Every village would be a self-sufficient republic or panchayat.
(Self-sufficiency did not mean that in times of need help
could not be taken from other villages.) The panchayat, the
unit of local self-government, will consist of five persons
– male and female – elected annually. It would represent the
village community and be the custodian of all authority.
Moreover, it would be an autonomous political institution in
the context of village administration.
Significantly, Gandhi said: “In the ideal State. . . there
is no political power because there is no State. But the ideal
is never fully realised in life. Hence the classical statement
of Thoreau that the government is best which governs the
least –is worthy of consideration.” As Judith Brown writes,
Gandhi “seems to have visualised a loose linkage of
independent village republics as the ideal form of the State…
he can therefore properly be called an anarchist.” In Gandhi’s
view, democracy would not be possible without high morality.
It is morality that develops a sense of responsibility in human
beings, and the strength of this sense of responsibility would
help them to respect and protect the rights of each other.
Gandhi laid more emphasis on duties than on rights.

426  

Militarism

Subhas Bose was deeply attracted to military discipline and
was thankful for the basic training he received in the
University Unit of the India Defence Force. He volunteered
to form a guard of honour during the ceremonial functions
at the Calcutta session of the Congress in 1930. And it was
done on a massive and grand scale. Bose, in full dress
uniform, reviewed his ‘troops’. Gandhi and most of his
supporters were uneasy with this display.
Gandhi was against the military on the whole. His
Ramrajya, being built on the concept of truth and nonviolence and self-regulation would be a perfect place and
would not require either police or grandiose armies. All
effort must be made to arrive at peace rather than go to war.
War, said Gandhi, “demoralises those who are trained for it.
It brutalises men of naturally gentle nature.” The main causes
of war, according to Gandhi, were racialism, imperialism and
fascism (in the context of the Second World War). He also
listed economic inequality and exploitation as additional
causes of war and instability in the international system. If
these were eradicated, there need not be any war. He was
not against defensive war: if the innocent were attacked, there
was no option but to defend oneself. So, of course, the
military was required for self-defence, but it was to be on
minimal scale.

Ideas on Economy

Gandhi’s concept of Swaraj had its own brand of economic
vision. He wanted a decentralised economy without state
control. Gandhi dismissed both capitalism and Western
socialism—the former for its exploitative excesses and the
latter for its connection to industrialisation. Both, he believed,
led human beings to crave for luxury and self-indulgence.
Gandhi wanted people to get rid of greed and make do with
just the bare necessities of life. He developed the idea of
village Sarvodaya. He advocated a “back to the roots” vision
when production was “simultaneous with consumption and
distribution and the vicious circle of money economy was
absent. Production was for immediate use and not for distant
markets.” What he wanted was the revival of ancient village

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  427

communities in which agriculture prospered, industry was
decentralised business was through small scale cooperative
organisations. He also wanted the participation of people at
all levels. In a letter he wrote to Henry Polak in 1909, Gandhi
expressed the view that India’s salvation lay in unlearning
what had been learnt; he wanted the railways, telegraphs,
hospitals, lawyers, doctors, and other modern trappings to be
discarded, and the so-called upper classes to learn to live
the simple life of the peasant.
He was against largescale industrialisation. He had
strong objections to labour saving machinery. “Men go on
saving labour, till thousands are without work and thrown on
the open streets to die of starvation”. He was not against
instruments and machinery that saved individual labour. He
wrote that “mechanisation is good when the hands are too
few for the work intended to be accomplished. It is an evil
when there are more hands than required for the work, as
is the case in India”.
The capitalist who amassed wealth was a thief, according
to Gandhi. In his opinion, if a person had inherited wealth
or had made a lot of money through trade and industry, the
amount was to be shared with the entire society and must
be spent on the welfare of all. He put forward his theory
of trusteeship under which he wanted the capitalists to be
trustees, and as such would take care of not only themselves
but also of others. The workers would consider the capitalists
as their benefactors and would keep faith in them. So there
would be mutual trust and confidence, and as a consequence
the ideal of economic equality could be achieved.
Bose considered economic freedom to be the essence
of social and political freedom. He was all in favour of
modernisation which was necessarily to be brought about by
industrialisation. He believed that India’s downfall in the
political and material sphere had been brought about by the
people’s inordinate belief in fate and the supernatural
accompanied by an indifference to modern scientific
developments, especially in the field of war weapons. He felt
the backward agriculture had to be modernised. The labour
that was ousted from the agricultural sector as a result of
such modernisation could be helped only with the development

428  

of industry, which could absorb the surplus labour from
agriculture.
In his speech at the Haripura Congress session, Bose
expressed his opinion that, for India to progress, a
comprehensive scheme of industrial development under stateownership and state-control would be indispensable. And he
spoke about the need to set up a planning commission to
advise the national government. He also spoke about abolition
of landlordism and liquidation of agricultural indebtedness.
He was much impressed by the success attained by the Soviet
Union in economic development through rapid industrialisation
within a short period of time.
Bose had his reasons for demanding industrialisation
for India. It would solve the problem of unemployment.
Socialism, he said, was to be the basis of national
reconstruction and socialism presupposed industrialisation.
Moreover, industrialisation was necessary if India were to
compete with foreign countries. Industrialisation was also
necessary for improving the standard of living of the people
at large. Bose classified industry into three categories: heavy,
medium, and cottage. Heavy industries, he said, form the
backbone of the national economy. But he was fully aware
of the great importance of cottage industries. “Industrialisation
does not ... mean that we turn our back on cottage industries.
. . . It only means that we shall have to decide which industries
should be developed on a cottage basis and which on a largescale basis.”

Religion

Gandhi said “God is Truth and Love; God is ethics and
morality; God is fearlessness. God is the source of Light
and Life and yet He is above and beyond all these, God is
conscience. He is even the atheism of the atheist. For in His
boundless love God permits the atheist to live.”
Gandhi was primarily a man of religion. He had a
steadfast view on religion, and his religion was the basis of
all his other ideas. Truth and non-violence were the two
principles that helped Gandhi in evolving a comprehensive
view of religion that went beyond narrow sectarianism. For
Gandhi there is no higher way of worshipping God than
serving the poor and identifying God in them.

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  429

He considered different religions to be merely the
different paths towards the same destination. Gandhi out of
his own experiences and readings came to the conclusion that
all religions are based on the same principles, namely, truth
and love. He claimed that religion is a binding force and not
a dividing force. He said that each person should follow his
or her own religion freely. He would not conceive of a state
without religion, for the basic tenets of his religion were
at the base of his idea of state too.
Subhash Bose believed in Upanishadic teachings. He
revered the Bhagavad Gita and was inspired by Vivekananda.
He was also inspired by the India of the past as reinterpreted
by thinkers. According to many scholars, Hindu spirituality
formed the essential part of his political and social thought
throughout his adult life. However, he was free of bigotry
or orthodoxy. He was for total non-discrimination on the
basis of religion and in context he took up the Hindus’ cause
when he demanded that Hindu prisoners be given the right
to do Durga Puja just as Muslims and Christians were allowed
to celebrate their festivals. Bose motivated Indians towards
freedom struggle through Hindu symbolisms as appropriate
for the audience. On December 9, 1930, he called upon the
women to participate in the liberation struggle, invoking the
imagery of Durga, a form of Shakti, ready to vanquish evil.
However, he was not a sectarian. He named his force Azad
Hind Fauz, and there were many non-Hindus in that army and
who were close to him. The INA was to be a mixture of
various religions, races, and castes with total social equality
of all soldiers. They were served food cooked in the common
kitchen and shared space in common barracks breaking the
age old caste bonds and practices. Common celebrations of
all religious festivals took place in the INA.
Bose was a secularist with an impartial attitude to all
religions. He said that Free India must have an absolutely
neutral and impartial attitude towards all religions and leave
it to the choice of individuals to profess or follow a particular
religion of his faith. Religion is a private matter, the State
has nothing to do with it. He opined that economic issues
cut across communal divisions and barriers.

430  

Caste and Untouchability

Gandhi’s goals for society were mainly three: eradicating
untouchability, maintaining the varna distinctions of the caste
system and strengthening tolerance, modesty and religiosity
in India.
Gandhi believed that one way of reinvigorating India
was to wipe out untouchability, which he considered to be
a pernicious practice preventing millions of peasants from
realising their dreams and aspirations. It was incompatible
with Swaraj. He said that if any Shastra propounded
untouchability that Shastra should be abandoned. He, however,
supported the varna system; he believed that the laws of caste
were eternal, and were the base for social harmony. In the
India that Gandhi visualised, each village would be organised
around the four-fold divisions with every member of society
doing his or her own duty. As there would be a complete
system of reciprocity, according to Gandhi, no one would
be subject to feelings of differences in status.
Bose looked forward to an India changed by a socialist
revolution that would bring to an end the traditional social
hierarchy with its caste system; in its place would come an
egalitarian, casteless and classless society. Subhas Bose
completely rejected social inequality and the caste system.
He spoke in favour of inter-caste marriages. In his public
speeches, Bose spoke vehemently against untouchability. He
was inspired by Vivekananda in his belief that the progress
of India would be possible only with uplift of the downtrodden
and the so-called untouchables.

Women

In Gandhi’s words, “To call women the weaker sex is a libel;
it is man’s injustice to women.” Gandhi played an important
role in uplifting the status of women in India.
Gandhi was instrumental in bringing women out of their
homes to take part in the struggle for freedom. It was, as
scholars point out, the most radical of his ideas. It involved
bringing women out of the purdah – a system that was
prevalent among Hindus as well as Muslims of the time. It
involved the possibility of being jailed and thus being
separated from their families. These were steps that were
revolutionary for those times.

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  431

Apart from bringing women into the struggle for swaraj,
he vehemently opposed various social ills affecting women
like child marriage, the dowry system and female infanticide,
and the treatment of widows.
He considered men and women to be equal and declared
that men should treat women with respect and consideration.
However, in the matter of the roles of men and women,
Gandhi would be regarded as patriarchal and traditional by
present standards. He wrote in 1937: “I do believe that woman
will not make her contribution to the world by mimicking
or running a race with man. She can run the race, but she
will not rise to the great heights she is capable of by
mimicking man. She has to be the complement of man.”
Again, in 1940, he wrote: “Whilst both are fundamentally one,
it is also equally true that in the form there is a vital
difference between the two. Hence, the vocations of the two
must also be different. Her duty of motherhood….requires
qualities which man need not possess. She is passive, he is
active. She is essentially mistress of the house. He is the
bread winner, she is the keeper and the distributor of the
bread. She is the caretaker in every sense of the term. The
art of bringing up the infants of the race is her special and
sole prerogative. Without her care, the race must become
extinct.”
Gandhi considered women to be the presiding deities
of the home. It was their dharma to take care of the home.
“If they do not follow dharma, the people would be totally
destroyed,” said Gandhi. However, Gandhi also said that
dharma did not imply brutish behaviour from men treating
women as chattel. Women should not tolerate ill-treatment
from their husbands. But he did not ask women to walk out
of their homes and launch agitations, personal or public,
against their plight or a satyagraha within their exploitative
domestic environments. He did say in 1940 that domestic
slavery of woman is a symbol of our barbarism, and she
should be “freed from this incubus”. He also wrote: “Women
may not look for protection to men. They must rely on their
own strength and purity of character and on God, as did
Draupadi of old.”
Clearly, his ideal woman, as Judith Brown observes, was

432  

not the ‘modern woman’, free of the restraints imposed on
her physically, socially and economically by virtue of her
being born female. He drew his symbol of his ideal woman
from the figure of Sita who bore patiently and bravely all
the injustices heaped on her by Rama. “Gandhi preached
female virtues of bravery and independence, and a capacity
to bear suffering; the model he offered to Indian women was
the virtuous and faithful wife,” says Judith Brown.
Subhash Bose had a more robust view of women.
Differing from the German National Socialists (Nazis) and
the Italian Fascists, who stressed the masculine in almost all
spheres of social and political activity, Bose considered
women to be the equals of men, and thus they should be
prepared to fight and sacrifice for the freedom of India. He
arduously campaigned to bring women more fully into the
life of the nation. In his presidential address at the Maharashtra
Provincial Conference in May 1928, he declared: “The status
of women should be raised and women should be trained to
take a larger and more intelligent interest in public affairs…
it is impossible for one half of the nation to win freedom
without the active sympathy and support of the other half.”
When, as Congress President in 1938, Bose set up the
Planning Commission, he insisted that there should be a
separate planning commission for women. This commission
was chaired by Rani Lakshmi Bhai Rajawade and was to deal
with the role of women in planned economy in future India.
Later, in 1943, he called on women to serve as soldiers
in the Indian National Army. This was a most radical view.
He formed a women’s regiment in the INA in 1943, named
the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. Many women were enthused
to join the regiment commanded by Captain Lakshmi
Swaminathan (Sahgal after marriage).While those less suited
to combat duties were employed as nurses and in other
support roles, the majority were trained as soldiers. They
were given the same treatment as the men and received no
special privileges.
In Bose’s view, women should be given a high position
in the family as well as in society. He believed in female
emancipation, in liberating women from age-old bondage to
customs and man-made disabilities, social, economic and

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  433

political. He wanted women to get all-round education
including not only literacy, but physical and vocational
training. He was all for abolition of purdah and also supported
widow remarriage. Women, he said, should also be made
conscious of their social and legal rights as well as their
duties as citizens.

Education

Gandhi was against the English system of education as also
against the use of English as a medium of instruction. He
wanted education to be in the vernacular. He advocated free
and compulsory education for all-boys and girls between 7
and 14 years.
In Gandhi’s view education should be an integrated
approach to the full development of the personality; it should
include physical training and high moral principles along with
intellectual and cognitive development. He differentiated
between learning and education, knowledge and wisdom,
literacy and lessons of life. According to him, “Literacy in
itself is no education”.
To Gandhi morality had to be a part of education. Taking
a leaf from Plato, Gandhi said that education should be a
means of attaining knowledge and wisdom that ultimately
place the seeker on the spiritual path. The end of education
was not merely a means to make a career and achieve social
status. Education should be a means to enlightenment. Gandhi
also wanted the Hindu scriptures to be a part of education
as they propounded discipline and self-restraint.
He conceived his Nai Talim or basic education for all
in 1937. Nai Talim aimed to impart education that would lead
to freedom from ignorance, illiteracy, superstition, psyche
of servitude, and many more taboos that inhibited free
thinking of a free India. This scheme of education was to
emphasise on holistic training of mind and body, so along
with academics, there was to be purposeful manual labour.
Handicrafts, art and drawing were the most fundamental
teaching tools in Nai Talim. As Gandhi wanted to make Indian
villages self-sufficient units, he emphasised on vocational
education which increases the efficiency of students in
undertaking tasks in those villages and make the village a selfsufficient unit.

434  

Subhash Bose was for higher education, especially in
the technical and scientific fields, as he wanted an industrial
India. He said, “National Reconstruction will be possible only
with the aid of science and our scientists.” He wanted Indian
students to be sent abroad for “training in accordance with
a clear and definite plan so that as soon as they returned
home, they may proceed straight away to build up new
industries”.

Second World War and
Nationalistic Response
On September 1, 1939, Germany attacked Poland – the action
that led to the Second World War. On September 3, 1939,
Britain declared war against Germany and the British
Government of India declared India’s support for the war
without consulting Indian opinion.

Congress Offer to Viceroy

Though the Congress did not like the unilateral action of the
British of drawing India into the war without consulting the
Indians, it decided to support the war effort conditionally.
The hostility of the Congress to Fascism, Nazism, militarism
and imperialism had been much more consistent than the
British record. The Indian offer to cooperate in the war effort
had two basic conditions:
1. After the war, a constituent assembly should be
convened to determine political structure of a free India.
2. Immediately, some form of a genuinely responsible
government should be established at the Centre.
The offer was rejected by Linlithgow, the viceroy. The
Congress argued that these conditions were necessary to win
public opinion for war.

CWC Meeting at Wardha

The official Congress position was adopted at the Wardha
session of the Congress Working Committee, but before that
different opinions were voiced on the question of Indian
support to British war efforts.
Gandhi, who had all sympathy for Britain in this war

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  435

because of his total dislike of the fascist ideology, advocated
an unconditional support to the Allied powers. He made a
clear distinction between the democratic nations of western
Europe and the totalitarian Nazis and fascists. He said that
he was not willing to embarrass the British government during
the war.
Subhas Bose and other socialists, such as Acharya
Narendra Dev and Jayaprakash Narayan, who had been invited
by the Congress to attend the Wardha meeting so that
different opinions could be discussed, had no sympathy for
either side in the war. In their opinion, the war was being
fought by imperialists on both sides; each side wanted to
protect its colonial possessions and gain more territories to
colonise, so neither side should be supported by the
nationalists. In fact, they thought it was the ideal time to
launch a civil disobedience movement, to thus take advantage
of the situation and snatch freedom from Britain.
Jawaharlal Nehru was not ready to accept the opinion
of either Gandhi or of the socialists. He was clear in his
mind about the difference between democratic values and
fascism.
He believed that justice was on the side of Britain,
France and Poland, but he also believed that Britain and
France were imperialist powers, and that “the war was the
result of the inner contradictions of capitalism maturing
since the end of World War I”. He, therefore, advocated no
Indian participation till India itself was free. However, at the
same time, no advantage was to be taken of Britain’s
difficulty by starting an immediate civil disobedience
movement.
Gandhi was more or less isolated in his stand. In the
end he decided to go with Nehru’s position, which was
adopted by the Congress Working Committee.
The CWC resolution condemned Fascist aggression.
It said that (i) India could not be party to a war being fought,
on the face of it, for democratic freedom, while that freedom
was being denied to India; (ii) if Britain was fighting for
democracy and freedom, it should be proved by ending
imperialism in its colonies and establishing full democracy
in India; (iii) the government should declare its war aims soon

436  

and, also, as to how the principles of democracy were to
be applied to India after the war.
The Congress leadership wanted “to give every chance
to the viceroy and the British Government”.

Government Attitude and
Congress Ministries’
Resignation
The government’s response was entirely negative. Viceroy
Linlithgow, in his statement, made on October 17, 1939, tried
to use the Muslim League and the princes against the
Congress. The government
● refused to define British war aims beyond stating
that Britain was resisting aggression;
● said it would, as part of future arrangement, consult
“representatives of several communities, parties and
interests in India, and the Indian princes” as to how
the Act of 1935 might be modified;
● said it would immediately set up a “consultative
committee” whose advice could be sought whenever
required.

Government’s Hidden Agenda

Linlithgow’s statement was not an aberration, but a part of
general British policy—“to take advantage of the war to
regain the lost ground from the Congress” by provoking the
Congress into a confrontation with the government and then
using the extraordinary situation to acquire draconian powers.
Even before the declaration of the War, emergency powers
had been acquired for the Centre in respect of provincial
subjects by amending the 1935 Act. Defence of India
ordinance had been enforced the day the War was declared,
thus restricting civil liberties. In May 1940, a top secret Draft
Revolutionary Movement Ordinance had been prepared, aimed
at launching crippling pre-emptive strikes on the Congress.
The government could then call upon the Allied troops
stationed in India. It could also win an unusual amount of
liberal and leftist sympathy all over the world by painting
an aggressive Congress as being pro-Japan and pro-Germany.

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  437

British Indian reactionary policies received full support
from the Prime Minister of Britain, Winston Churchill, and
the Secretary of State, Zetland, who branded the Congress
as a purely Hindu organisation.
It became clear that the British government had no
intention of loosening its hold, during or after the war, and
was willing to treat the Congress as an enemy.
Gandhi reacted sharply to the government’s insensitivity
to Indian public opinion—“... there is to be no democracy
for India if Britain can prevent it.” Referring to the minorities
and other special interests, Gandhi said, “Congress will
safeguard minority rights provided they do not advance claims
inconsistent with India’s independence.”
Congress Ministries Decide to Resign
On October 23, 1939, the CWC meeting
● rejected the viceregal statement as a reiteration of
the old imperialist policy;
● decided not to support the war; and
● called upon the Congress ministries to resign in the
provinces.
Debate on the Question of Immediate Mass
Satyagraha
After Linlithgow’s statement of October 1939, the debate on
the question of immediate mass struggle began once again.
Gandhi and his supporters were not in favour of an immediate
struggle because they felt that the
●
allied cause was just;
●
communal sensitiveness and lack of Hindu-Muslim
unity could result in communal riots;
●
Congress organisation was in shambles and the
atmosphere was not conducive for a mass struggle;
and
●
masses were not ready for a struggle.
They instead advocated toning up the Congress
organisation, carrying on political work among the masses,
and negotiating till all possibilities of a negotiated settlement
were exhausted. Only then would the struggle be begun.
In January 1940, Linlithgow stated, “Dominion status
of Westminster variety, after the war, is the goal of British
policy in India.”

438  

In its meeting in Allahabad in November 1939, the
Congress Working Committee passed a resolution observing
that “the course of the war and the policy pursued by the
British and the French governments and in particular the
declarations made on behalf of the British government in
regard to India, seem to demonstrate that the present war,
like the World War of 1914-18, is being carried on for
imperialist ends, and the British imperialism is to remain
entrenched in India. With such a war and with this policy
the Congress cannot associate itself, and it cannot countenance
the exploitation of India’s resources to this end.” It was
reiterated that India’s independence and of the right of Indians
to frame their constitution through a constituent assembly
should be recognised and that it was only through such a
constituent assembly that communal and other problems
could be tackled.
The Ramgarh session of the Congress was held in
March 1940 with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in the president’s
chair. All agreed that a battle must be waged but there was
disagreement over the form. It was decided to leave the form
and timing to Gandhi. But even now, Gandhi was in favour
of continued cooperation at the provincial level. He said that
he would offer the British moral support during the war but
on a non-violent basis. However, Jawaharlal Nehru reiterated
that complete independence for India must be a precondition
for Congress support to the British war effort. Subhash Bose
continued with his strong militant stand of direct action
against the colonial government forcing it to agree to the
grant of freedom. Once again he pointed out that Britain’s
difficulty was to be seized as India’s opportunity.
The Congress finally declared at the session that the
people of India would accept nothing short of complete
independence. Indian freedom could not be in the form of
dominion or any other status within the imperial structure.
Sovereignty, said the Congress resolution, must rest with the
people, whether in the States (the princely states) or the
provinces. It was also decided that “Congress would resort
to civil disobedience as soon as the Congress organisation
is considered fit enough or if circumstances precipitate a
crisis.”

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  439

Pakistan Resolution—Lahore (March 1940)
The Muslim League passed a resolution calling for “grouping
of geographically contiguous areas where Muslims are in
majority (North-West, East) into independent states in which
constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign and
adequate safeguards to Muslims where they are in minority”.

August Offer
Hitler’s astounding success and the fall of Belgium, Holland
and France put England in a conciliatory mood. As the war
in Europe had undertaken a new turn, the dominant Congress
leadership was again in a dilemma. Both Gandhi and Nehru
strongly opposed the idea of taking advantage of Britain’s
position.
The Congress was ready to compromise, asking the
British government to let it form an interim government
during the war period but the government was not interested.
The government came up with its own offer to get the
cooperation of India in the war effort. Linlithgow announced
the August Offer (August 1940) which proposed:
● dominion status as the objective for India;
● expansion of viceroy’s executive council which
would have a majority of Indians (who would be
drawn from major political parties);
● setting up of a constituent assembly after the war
where mainly Indians would decide the constitution
according to their social, economic and political
conceptions, subject to fulfilment of the obligation
of the government regarding defence, minority rights,
treaties with States, all India services; and
● no future constitution to be adopted without the
consent of minorities.

Responses

The Congress rejected the August Offer. Nehru said,
“Dominion status concept is dead as a doornail.” Gandhi said
that the declaration had widened the gulf between the
nationalists and the British rulers.
The Muslim League welcomed the veto assurance given
to the League, and reiterated its position that partition was
the only solution to the deadlock.

440  

Evaluation

For the first time, the inherent right of Indians to frame their
constitution was recognised and the Congress demand for a
constituent assembly was conceded. Dominion status was
explicitly offered.
In July 1941, the viceroy’s executive council was
enlarged to give the Indians a majority of 8 out of 12 for
the first time, but the British remained in charge of defence,
finance and home. Also, a National Defence Council was set
up with purely advisory functions.

Individual Satyagraha
The government had taken the adamant position that no
constitutional advance could be made till the Congress came
to an agreement with the Muslim leaders. It issued ordinance
after ordinance taking away the freedom of speech and that
of the press and the right to organise associations.
Towards the end of 1940, the Congress once again
asked Gandhi to take command. Gandhi now began taking
steps which would lead to a mass struggle within his broad
strategic perspective. He decided to initiate a limited
satyagraha on an individual basis by a few selected individuals
in every locality.
The aims of launching individual satyagraha were—(i)
to show that nationalist patience was not due to weakness;
(ii) to express people’s feeling that they were not interested
in the war and that they made no distinction between Nazism
and the double autocracy that ruled India; and (iii) to give
another opportunity to the government to accept Congress’
demands peacefully.
The demand of the satyagrahi would be the freedom
of speech against the war through an anti-war declaration. If
the government did not arrest the satyagrahi, he or she would
June 1941: Germany attacks Russia and Russia is dragged into
the War.
December 1941: Japan attacks Pearl Harbour.
March 1942: After having overrun almost the whole of SouthEast Asia, Japan occupies Rangoon.

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  441

not only repeat it but move into villages and start a march
towards Delhi, thus precipitating a movement which came to
be known as the ‘Delhi Chalo Movement’.
Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer the satyagraha and
Nehru, the second. By May 1941, 25,000 people had been
convicted for individual civil disobedience.

Gandhi Designates Nehru as his
Successor
The Congress leaders, released in December 1941, in the
midst of Japan’s aggressive actions, were anxious to defend
Indian territory and go to the aid of the Allies. The CWC
overrode Gandhi’s and Nehru’s objections and passed a
resolution offering to cooperate with the government in the
defence of India, if
(i) full independence was given after the war, and
(ii) substance of power was transferred immediately.
It was at this time that Gandhi designated Nehru as his
chosen successor.
Nehru and Gandhi differed in temperament and attitudes
towards modernity, religion, God, State and industrialisation.
Nehru was indifferent to religion, Gandhi believed deeply in
his own version of God; Nehru believed that industrialisation
was the only solution to the acute and widespread poverty
of India, while Gandhi called for the reviving of the rural
economy. Nehru believed in the powers of the modern State
to elevate and reform society, while Gandhi was sceptical
of State power, trusting instead to the conscience and
willingness of individuals and communities. Despite having
so many differences, Nehru revered Gandhi, and Gandhi, in
turn, believed in Nehru more than his own sons. Both teacher
and disciple had fundamental similarities—patriotism in an
inclusive sense, i.e., they identified with India as a whole
rather than with a particular caste, language, region or
religion. Both believed in non-violence and democratic form
of government.
Rajmohan Gandhi, in his book, The Good Boatman,
writes that Gandhi preferred Nehru to the alternatives because

442  

he most reliably reflected the pluralist, inclusive idea of India
that the Mahatma himself stood for. The alternatives—Patel,
Rajaji, Azad, Kripalani, Rajendra Prasad—had somewhat
sectional interests and affiliations. But Nehru was a Hindu
who could be trusted by Muslims, a north-Indian who was
respected in south India, and a man who was admired by
women. Like Gandhi, Nehru was genuinely an all-India leader,
who gave Indians hope—that they could build a more
prosperous and peaceful society.

Cripps Mission
In March 1942, a mission headed by Stafford Cripps was sent
to India with constitutional proposals to seek Indian support
for the war. Stafford Cripps was a left-wing Labourite, the
leader of the House of Commons and a member of the British
War Cabinet who had actively supported the Indian national
movement.

Why Cripps Mission was Sent

● Because of the reverses suffered by Britain in SouthEast Asia, the Japanese threat to invade India seemed real
now and Indian support became crucial.
● There was pressure on Britain from the Allies (USA,
USSR, China) to seek Indian cooperation.
● Indian nationalists had agreed to support the Allied
cause if substantial power was transferred immediately and
complete independence given after the war.

Main Proposals

The main proposals of the mission were as follows.
1. An Indian Union with a dominion status would be
set up; it would be free to decide its relations with the
Commonwealth and free to participate in the United Nations
and other international bodies.
2. After the end of the war, a constituent assembly
would be convened to frame a new constitution. Members
of this assembly would be partly elected by the provincial
assemblies through proportional representation and partly
nominated by the princes.
3. The British government would accept the new

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  443

constitution subject to two conditions: (i) any province not
willing to join the Union could have a separate constitution
and form a separate Union, and (ii) the new constitutionmaking body and the British government would negotiate a
treaty to effect the transfer of power and to safeguard racial
and religious minorities.
4. In the meantime, defence of India would remain in
British hands and the governor-general’s powers would
remain intact.

Departures from the Past and Implications

The proposals differed from those offered in the past in many
respects—
● The making of the constitution was to be solely in
Indian hands now (and not ‘mainly’ in Indian hands—as
contained in the August Offer).
● A concrete plan was provided for the constituent
assembly.
● Option was available to any province to have a
separate constitution—a blueprint for India’s partition.
● Free India could withdraw from the Commonwealth.
● Indians were allowed a large share in the administration
in the interim period.

Why Cripps Mission Failed

The Cripps Mission proposals failed to satisfy Indian
nationalists and turned out to be merely a propaganda device
for the consumption of the US and the Chinese. Various
parties and groups had objections to the proposals on
different points—
The Congress objected to:
(i) the offer of dominion status instead of a provision
for complete independence;
(ii) representation of the princely states by nominees
and not by elected representatives;
(iii) right to provinces to secede as this went against the
principle of national unity; and
(iv) absence of any plan for immediate transfer of power
and absence of any real share in defence; the
governor-general’s supremacy had been retained,
and the demand that the governor-general be only
the constitutional head had not been accepted.

444  

Nehru and Maulana Azad were the official negotiators
for the Congress.
The Muslim League
(i) criticised the idea of a single Indian Union;
(ii) did not like the machinery for the creation of a
constituent assembly and the procedure to decide
on the accession of provinces to the Union; and
(iii) thought that the proposals denied the Muslims the
right to self-determination and the creation of
Pakistan.
Other groups also objected to the provinces’ right to
secede. The Liberals considered the secession proposals to
be against the unity and security of India. The Hindu
Mahasabha criticised the basis of the right to secede. The
depressed classes thought that partition would leave them at
the mercy of the caste Hindus. The Sikhs objected that
partition would take away Punjab from them.
The explanation that the proposals were meant not to
supersede the August Offer but to clothe general provisions
with precision cast doubts on the British intentions.
The incapacity of Cripps to go beyond the Draft
Declaration and the adoption of a rigid “take it or leave it”
attitude added to the deadlock. Cripps had earlier talked of
“cabinet” and “national government” but later he said that he
had only meant an expansion of the executive council.
The procedure of accession was not well-defined. The
decision on secession was to be taken by a resolution in the
legislature by a 60 per cent majority. If less than 60 per cent
Views
I have not become His Majesty’s first Minister to preside over
the liquidation of the British Empire.
Winston Churchill
The offer of Cripps really gave us nothing. If we accepted his
offer, we might have cause to rue it in future. In case the British
went back on their word, we should not even have the justification
for launching a fresh struggle. War had given India an opportunity
for achieving her freedom. We must not lose it by depending
upon a mere promise.
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad

Nationalist Response in the Wake of World War II  445

of members supported it, the decision was to be taken by
a plebiscite of adult males of that province by a simple
majority. This scheme weighed against the Hindus in Punjab
and Bengal if they wanted accession to the Indian Union.
It was not clear as to who would implement and
interpret the treaty effecting the transfer of power.
Churchill (the British prime minister), Amery (the
secretary of state), Linlithgow (the viceroy) and Ward (the
commander-in-chief) consistently torpedoed Cripps’ efforts.
Talks broke down on the question of the viceroy’s veto.
Gandhi described the scheme as “a post-dated cheque”;
Nehru pointed out that the “existing structure and autocratic
powers would remain and a few of us will become the
viceroy’s liveried camp followers and look after canteens and
the like”.
Stafford Cripps returned home leaving behind a frustrated
and embittered Indian people, who, though still sympathising
with the victims of Fascist aggression, felt that the existing
situation in the country had become intolerable and that the
time had come for a final assault on imperialism.
Summary
●

Congress Stand on World War II:
It would cooperate in the war effort if:
(i) freedom was given after the War.
(ii) some form of genuinely responsible government was

declared India’s support for war.
September 10-14, 1939: At CWC meeting at Wardha:
— Gandhi was for unconditional support to Britain’s war
efforts.
— Subhash Bose and Leftists were for taking advantage of

Chapter 23

Quit India Movement,
Demand for Pakistan,
and the INA
Quit India Movement
After Cripps’ departure, Gandhi framed a resolution calling
for British withdrawal and a non-violent non-cooperation
movement against any Japanese invasion. The CWC meeting
at Wardha (July 14, 1942) accepted the idea of a struggle.

Why Start a Struggle Now

The reasons were several—
1. The failure of the Cripps Mission to solve the
constitutional deadlock exposed Britain’s unchanged attitude
on constitutional advance and made it clear that any more
silence would be tantamount to accepting the British right
to decide the fate of Indians without consulting them.
2. There was popular discontent because of rising
prices and shortage of rice, salt, etc., and because of factors
such as commandeering of boats in Bengal and Orissa. There
were fears of Britain following a scorched earth policy in
Assam, Bengal and Orissa against possible Japanese advance.
3. News of reverses suffered by the British in SouthEast Asia and an imminent British collapse enhanced popular
willingness to give expression to discontent. The Japanese
troops were approaching the borders of India. Popular faith
447

448  

in the stability of British rule was so low that people were
withdrawing deposits from banks and post offices.
4. The manner in which the British evacuated from
South-East Asia leaving the subjects to their fate (two roads
were provided—Black Road for Indian refugees and White
Road exclusively for European refugees), and the rout of a
European power by an Asian power shattered white prestige
and the British behaviour towards the Indian subjects in
South-East Asia exposed the racist attitude of the rulers.
5. The leadership wanted to condition the masses for
a possible Japanese invasion.

The ‘Quit India’ Resolution

In July 1942, the Congress Working Committee met at
Wardha and resolved that it would authorise Gandhi to take
charge of the non-violent mass movement. The resolution
generally referred to as the ‘Quit India’ resolution. Proposed
by Jawaharlal Nehru and seconded by Sardar Patel, it was to
be approved by the All India Congress Committee meeting
in Bombay in August.
The Quit India Resolution was ratified at the Congress
meeting at Gowalia Tank, Bombay, on August 8, 1942. The
meeting also resolved to
● demand an immediate end to British rule in India.
● declare commitment of free India to defend itself
against all types of Fascism and imperialism.
● form a provisional Government of India after British
withdrawal.
● sanction a civil disobedience movement against
British rule.
Gandhi was named the leader of the struggle.

Gandhi’s General Instructions to
Different Sections

Gandhi’s special instructions were spelt out at the Gowalia
Tank meeting but not actually issued. They were directed at
various sections of society.
● Government servants: Do not resign but declare
your allegiance to the Congress.
● Soldiers: Do not leave the Army but do not fire on
compatriots.

Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, ...

 449

Students: If confident, leave studies.
Peasants: If zamindars are anti-government, pay
mutually agreed rent, and if zamindars are pro-government,
do not pay rent.
● Princes: Support the masses and accept sovereignty
of your people.
● Princely states’ people: Support the ruler only if
he is anti-government and declare yourselves to be a part of
the Indian nation.
Gandhi followed up with the now-famous exhortation:
“Here is a mantra, a short one, that I give you. You may
imprint it on your hearts and let every breath of yours give
expression to it. The mantra is: ‘Do or Die’. We shall either
free India or die in the attempt; we shall not live to see the
perpetuation of our slavery.”

Spread of the Movement

Gandhi had carefully built the tempo through individual civil
disobedience movements or satyagraha, organisational
revamping and a consistent propaganda campaign. The
government, however, was in no mood to either negotiate
with the Congress or wait for the movement to be formally
launched.
In the early hours of August 9, 1942, in a single sweep,
all the top leaders of the Congress were arrested and taken
to unknown destinations. The Congress Working Committee,
the All India Congress Committee and the Provincial Congress
Committees were declared unlawful associations under the
Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908. The assembly of
public meetings was prohibited under rule 56 of the Defence
of India Rules. The removal of established leaders left the
younger and militant elements to their own initiative. With
the major leaders out of the picture, young Aruna Asaf Ali,
till then relatively unknown, presided over the Congress
committee session on August 9, and hoisted the flag.
Public on Rampage
The general public attacked symbols of authority, and hoisted
national flags forcibly on public buildings. Satyagrahis offered
themselves up to arrest, bridges were blown up, railway tracks
were removed and telegraph lines were cut. This kind of

450  

activity was most intense in eastern United Provinces and
Bihar. Students responded by going on strike in schools and
colleges, participating in processions, writing and distributing
illegal news sheets (patrikas) and acting as couriers for
underground networks. Workers went on strike in Ahmedabad,
Bombay, Jamshedpur, Ahmednagar and Poona.
Underground Activity
Many nationalists went underground and took to subversive
activities. The participants in these activities were the
Socialists, Forward Bloc members, Gandhi ashramites,
revolutionary nationalists and local organisations in Bombay,
Poona, Satara, Baroda and other parts of Gujarat, Karnataka,
Kerala, Andhra, United Provinces, Bihar and Delhi. The main
personalities taking up underground activity were Rammanohar
Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali, Usha Mehta, Biju
Patnaik, Chhotubhai Puranik, Achyut Patwardhan, Sucheta
Kripalani and R.P. Goenka. Usha Mehta started an underground
radio in Bombay. This phase of underground activity was
meant to keep up popular morale by continuing to provide
a line of command and guidance to distribute arms and
ammunition.
View
. . . though the need for non-violence was always reiterated,
Gandhi’s mantra of Do or Die represents the militant mood of
Gandhi.

Parallel Governments
Parallel governments were established at many places:
● Ballia (in August 1942 for a week)—under Chittu
Pandey. He got many Congress leaders released.
● Tamluk (Midnapore, from December 1942 to
September 1944)—Jatiya Sarkar undertook cyclone relief
work, sanctioned grants to schools, supplied paddy from the
rich to the poor, organised Vidyut Vahinis, etc.
● Satara (mid-1943 to 1945)—named “Prati Sarkar”, was
organised under leaders like Y.B. Chavan, Nana Patil, etc.
Village libraries and Nyayadan Mandals were organised,

Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, ...

 451

prohibition campaigns were carried on and ‘Gandhi marriages’
were organised.
Active help was provided by businessmen (through
donations, shelter and material help), students (acting as
couriers), simple villagers (by refusing information to
authority), pilots and train drivers (by delivering bombs and
other material) and government officials including police
(who passed on secret information to the activists).

Extent of Mass Participation

The participation was on many levels.
Youth, especially the students of schools and colleges,
remained in the forefront.
Women, especially school and college girls, actively
participated, and included Aruna Asaf Ali, Sucheta Kripalani
and Usha Mehta.
Workers went on strikes and faced repression.
Peasants of all strata were at the heart of the movement.
Even some zamindars participated. These peasants concentrated
their offensive on symbols of authority and there was
complete absence of anti-zamindar violence.
Government officials, especially those belonging to
lower levels in police and administration, participated resulting
in erosion of government loyalty.
Muslims helped by giving shelter to underground
activists. There were no communal clashes during the
movement.
The Communists did not join the movement; in the
wake of Russia (where the communists were in power) being
attacked by Nazi Germany, the communists began to support
the British war against Germany and the ‘Imperialist War’
became the ‘People’s War’.
The Muslim League opposed the movement, fearing
that if the British left India at that time, the minorities would
be oppressed by the Hindus.
The Hindu Mahasabha boycotted the movement.
The Princely states showed a low-key response.

Government Repression

Although martial law was not applied, the repression was
severe. Agitating crowds were lathi-charged, tear-gassed and

452  

fired upon. The number of those killed is estimated at 10,000.
The press was muzzled. The military took over many cities;
police and secret service reigned supreme. Rebellious villages
were fined heavily and in many villages, mass flogging was
done.

Estimate

● Left without leaders, there was no restraint and
violence became common.
● Main storm centres of the movement were in eastern
United Provinces, Bihar, Midnapore, Maharashtra, Karnataka.
● Students, workers and peasants were the backbone of
the movement while the upper classes and the bureaucracy
remained largely loyal.
● Loyalty to government suffered considerable erosion.
This also showed how deep nationalism had reached.
● The movement established the truth that it was no
longer possible to rule India without the wishes of Indians.
● The element of spontaneity was higher than before,
although a certain degree of popular initiative had been
sanctioned by the leadership itself, subject to limitations of
the instructions. Also, the Congress had been ideologically,
politically and organisationally preparing for the struggle for
a long time.
● The great significance was that the movement placed
the demand for independence on the immediate agenda of
the national movement. After Quit India, there could be no
retreat.
● In this struggle, the common people displayed unparalleled heroism and militancy. The repression they faced was
the most brutal, and the circumstances under which resistance
was offered were most adverse.

Gandhi Fasts

In February 1943, Gandhi started a fast as an answer to an
exhortation by the government to condemn violence; the fast
was directed against the violence of the State. The popular
response to the news of the fast was immediate and
overwhelming. Protests were organised at home and abroad
through hartals, demonstrations and strikes. Three members

Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, ...

 453

of the viceroy’s executive council resigned. The fast achieved
the following—
● public morale was raised.
● anti-British feeling was heightened.
● an opportunity was provided for political activity.
● Government’s high-handedness was exposed.
Gandhi got the better of his opponents and refused to
oblige by dying.
On March 23, 1943 Pakistan Day was observed.

Famine of 1943
The horror and inconveniences of war were increased by the
famine of 1943. The worst-affected areas were south-west
Bengal comprising the Tamluk-Contai-Diamond Harbour
region, Dacca, Faridpur, Tippera and Noakhali. Around 1.5
to 3 million people perished in this basically man-made
famine, the epidemics (malaria, cholera, small pox),
malnutrition and starvation. The fundamental causes of the
famine were as follows.
1. The need to feed a vast Army diverted foodstuffs.
2. Rice imports from Burma and South-East Asia had
been stopped.
3. The famine got aggravated by gross mismanagement
and deliberate profiteering; rationing methods were belated
and were confined to big cities.

Rajagopalachari Formula
Meanwhile, efforts were on to solve the ongoing constitutional
crisis, and some individuals also tried to come up with
constitutional proposals.

The Formula

C. Rajagopalachari (CR), the veteran Congress leader,
prepared a formula for Congress-League cooperation in
1944. It was a tacit acceptance of the League’s demand for
Pakistan. Gandhi supported the formula. The main points in
the CR Plan were:
● Muslim League to endorse Congress demand for
independence.

454  
● League to cooperate with Congress in forming a
provisional government at centre.
● After the end of the war, the entire population of
Muslim majority areas in the North-West and North-East
India to decide by a plebiscite, whether or not to form a
separate sovereign state.
● In case of acceptance of partition, agreement to be
made jointly for safeguarding defence, commerce,
communications, etc.
● The above terms to be operative only if England
transferred full powers to India.

Objections

Jinnah wanted the Congress to accept the two-nation theory.
He wanted only the Muslims of North-West and North-East
to vote in the plebiscite and not the entire population. He
also opposed the idea of a common centre.
While the Congress was ready to cooperate with the
League for the independence of the Indian Union, the League
did not care for independence of the Union. It was only
interested in a separate nation.
Hindu leaders led by Vir Savarkar condemned the CR
Plan.

Desai-Liaqat Pact
Efforts continued to end the deadlock. Bhulabhai Desai,
leader of the Congress Party in the Central Legislative
Assembly, met Liaqat Ali Khan, deputy leader of the Muslim
League in that Assembly, and both of them came up with
the draft proposal for the formation of an interim government
at the centre, consisting of—
● an equal number of persons nominated by the
Congress and the League in the central legislature.
● 20% reserved seats for minorities.
No settlement could be reached between the Congress
and the League on these lines, but the fact that a sort of
parity between the Congress and the League was decided upon
had far-reaching consequences.

Wavell Plan
Although the war in Europe came to an end in May 1945,
the Japanese threat still remained. The Conservative

Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, ...

 455

government in Britain led by Churchill was keen to reach
a solution on the constitutional question in India. The viceroy,
Lord Wavell was permitted to start negotiations with Indian
leaders. Congress leaders were released from jails in June
1945.

Why the Government was Keen on a
Solution Now

1. The general election in England was scheduled for
mid-1945. The Conservatives wanted to be seen as sincere
on reaching a solution.
2. There was pressure from the Allies to seek further
Indian cooperation in the war.
3. The government wanted to divert Indian energies into
channels more profitable for the British.

The Plan

The idea was to reconstruct the governor-general’s executive
council pending the preparation of a new constitution. For
this purpose, a conference was convened by the viceroy, Lord
Wavell, at Shimla in June 1945. The main proposals of the
Wavell Plan were as follows.
● With the exception of the governor-general and the
commander-in-chief, all members of the executive council
were to be Indians.
● Caste Hindus and Muslims were to have equal
representation.
● The reconstructed council was to function as an
interim government within the framework of the 1935 Act
(i.e. not responsible to the Central Assembly).
● The governor-general was to exercise his veto on the
advice of ministers.
● Representatives of different parties were to submit
a joint list to the viceroy for nominations to the executive
council. If a joint list was not possible, then separate lists
were to be submitted.
● Possibilities were to be kept open for negotiations
on a new constitution once the war was finally won.

Muslim League’s Stand

The League wanted all Muslim members to be League
nominees, because it feared that since the aims of other

456  

minorities—depressed classes, Sikhs, Christians, etc.—were
the same as those of the Congress, this arrangement would
reduce the League to a one-third minority. (Wavell wanted
Khizr Hyat Khan as the Muslim representative from Western
Punjab.) The League claimed some kind of veto in the council
with decisions opposed to Muslims needing a two-thirds
majority for approval.

Congress Stand

The Congress objected to the plan as “an attempt to reduce
the Congress to the status of a purely caste Hindu party and
insisted on its right to include members of all communities
among its nominees”.

Wavell’s Mistake

Wavell announced a breakdown of talks thus giving the
League a virtual veto. This strengthened the League’s position,
as was evident from the elections in 1945-46, and boosted
Jinnah’s position; and exposed the real character of the
Conservative government of Churchill.

The Indian National Army
and Subhash Bose
Subhash Chandra Bose was an intrepid man. He had always
shown a militant streak and reacted violently to any insult
of Indians by the Europeans. He passed the Indian Civil
Services examination securing fourth position but resigned
from the service in 1921 to join the struggle for freedom
by becoming a member of the Congress. His political guru
was Chittaranjan Das. He became mayor of Calcutta in 1923.
He was jailed many times by the British. Once it became
clear to Subhash Chandra Bose that he could not follow
Gandhi’s way but that the Congress was determined to follow
Gandhi, Bose decided to go his own way to fight for
independence.
In March 1940, Bose convened an Anti-Compromise
Conference at Ramgarh; it was a joint effort of the Forward
Bloc and the Kisan Sabha. It was resolved at the conference
that a world-wide struggle should be launched on April 6,

Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, ...

 457

the first day of the National Week, with a call to the people
not to help the Imperialist War with any resource—men,
money or materials. He called for resistance to be offered
to all forms of exploitation of Indian resources for the
imperial cause. There was enthusiastic participation by the
people in the struggle launched on April 6.
Bose was arrested in July when he protested and tried
to launch a satyagraha against a proposed monument for
Holwell in Calcutta. He was released from prison and placed
under house arrest in December 1940 after a hunger strike.
In January 1941, it was reported that Bose had escaped. On
January 26, 1941, he reached Peshawar under the pseudoname Ziauddin, helped by Bhagat Ram.
Later it was heard that he had left India “to supplement
from outside the struggle going on at home”. He was
reported to have approached Russia for help in the Indian
struggle for freedom from Britain. But, in June 1941, Russia
joined the Allies in the war, which disappointed Bose. He
then went to Germany.
Bose met Hitler under the pseudo name, Orlando
Mazzotta. With the help of Hitler, the ‘Freedom Army’
(Mukti Sena) was formed which consisted of all the prisoners
of war of Indian origin captured by Germany and Italy.
Dresden, Germany was made the office of the Freedom
Army. Bose came to be called ‘Netaji’ by the people of
Germany. He gave the famous slogan, ‘Jai Hind’ from the
Free India Centre, Germany.
He began regular broadcasts from Berlin radio in
January 1942, which enthused Indians. In early 1943, he left
Germany and travelled by German and later by Japanese
submarines to reach Japan and then Singapore in July of the
same year. He was to take over command of the Indian
independence movement from Rashbehari Bose, but that was
the second phase of the Indian National Army.

Origin and First Phase of the Indian
National Army

The idea of creating an army out of the Indian prisoners of
war (POWs) was originally that of Mohan Singh, an Indian
army officer who had decided not to join the retreating

458  

British army in Malaya. He decided to turn to the Japanese
for help. The Japanese had till then encouraged Indian
civilians to form anti-British organisations. Mohan Singh
asked for Indian prisoners of war.
The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war
to Mohan Singh who tried to recruit them into an Indian
National Army. After the fall of Singapore, several POWs
were ready to join Mohan Singh. By the end of 1942, 40,000
men were ready to join the INA. It was intended that the INA
would go into action only on the invitation of the Indian
National Congress and the people of India. The move to form
this army has been seen by many as a check against the
misconduct of the Japanese against Indians in South-East Asia
and as a bulwark against a possible future Japanese occupation
of India.
The INA got a boost with the outbreak of the Quit India
Movement in India. In September 1942, the first division of
the INA was formed with 16,300 men. With the Japanese
contemplating an Indian invasion, the idea of an armed wing
of INA seemed more relevant to them. But soon, serious
differences emerged between the Indian Army officers led
by Mohan Singh and the Japanese over the role to be played
by the INA. Actually, the Japanese wanted a token force of
2,000 only while Mohan Singh wanted to raise a much larger
army. Mohan Singh was taken into custoday by the Japanese.
The second phase began with the arrival of Subhash
Bose in Singapore. But before that in June 1943, Subhash
Chandra Bose (under pseudo name Abid Hussain) reached
Tokyo; met the Japanese prime minister, Tojo.
The role of Rasbehari Bose, another great freedom
fighter, should also be acknowledged here. He had fled to
Japan in 1915 following the failed revolutionary activities.
In Japan, Rashbehari Bose eventually became a naturalised
citizen. He made a lot of effort in getting the Japanese
interested in the Indian independence movement. He became
active in Pan-Asian circles, founded the Indian Club of Tokyo,
and gave lectures on the evils of Western imperialism.
Very early itself he was impressed by Subhash Chandra
Bose. When the Indian National Army was formed by Mohan
Singh in Singapore, Rashbehari Bose was greatly excited and

Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, ...

 459

left Tokyo for Southeast Asia. It was at a conference in
Bangkok (also under Japanese occupation at the time) that
it was decided to place the INA under an Indian Independence
League whose chairman would be Rashbehari Bose himself.
He had created the League in 1942 in Tokyo.
When Subhash Bose was sought by the Japanese to lead
the INA, he was ready for it. He went to Singapore and met
Rashbehari Bose, and the latter happily transferred the
control and leadership of the Indian Independence League and
the INA to Subhash in July 1943. It must be noted that it
was on the organisational spadework done by Rashbehari
Bose that Subhas Bose could build up the Indian National
Army. Subhash Bose became Supreme Commander of the
INA on August 25. (In February 1944, after a collapse of
the lungs, Rashbehari’s health steadily deteriorated, and he
died on January 21, 1945, aged 58.)
On October 21, 1943, Subhash Bose formed the
Provisional Government for Free India at Singapore with H.C.
Chatterjee (Finance portfolio), M.A. Aiyar (Broadcasting),
Lakshmi Swaminathan (Women Department), etc. The famous
slogan—“Give me blood, I will give you freedom” was given
in Malaya.
This provisional government declared war on Britain
and the United States, and was recognised by the Axis powers.
Recruits were trained and funds collected for the INA. A
women’s regiment called the Rani Jhansi Regiment was also
formed.
The INA headquarters was shifted to Rangoon (in
Burma) in January 1944, and the army recruits were to march
from there with the war cry “Chalo Delhi!” on their lips.
On November 6, 1943, Andaman and Nicobar islands
was given by the Japanese army to the INA; the islands were
renamed as Shahid Dweep and Swaraj Dweep respectively.
On July 6, 1944, Subhas Bose addressed Mahatma
Gandhi as ‘Father of Nation’—from the Azad Hind Radio (the
first person to call Gandhi, ‘Father of Nation’). He asked for
Gandhi’s blessings for “India’s last war of independence”.
One INA battalion commanded by Shah Nawaz was
allowed to accompany the Japanese Army to the Indo-Burma
front and participate in the Imphal campaign. However, the

460  

Indians received discriminatory treatment from the Japanese,
which included being denied rations and arms and being made
to do menial work for the Japanese units, and this disgusted
and demoralised the INA units.
The Azad Hind Fauz crossed the Burma border, and
stood on Indian soil on March 18, 1944. The INA units
subsequently advanced up to Kohima and Imphal. On April
14, Colonel Malik of the Bahadur Group hoisted the INA
flag for the first time on the Indian mainland at Moirang,
in Manipur (where the INA Memorial Complex stands today)
to enthusiastic cries of “Jai Hind” and “Netaji Zindabad”. For
three months the INA carried out military administration
duties at Moirang but then the Allied forces reclaimed the
territory. The INA met the same fate as the Japanese, and
all brigades began their withdrawal on July 18, 1944.
The steady Japanese retreat thereafter quashed any
hopes of the INA liberating the nation. The retreat continued
till mid-1945.
On August 15, 1945 the surrender of Japan in the
Second World War took place and with this the INA also
surrendered.
On August 18, 1945, reportedly, Subhash Bose died
mysteriously in an air-crash at Taipei (Taiwan).
But when the INA POWs were brought back to India
after the war to be court-martialled, a powerful movement
emerged in their defence.

Chapter 24

Post-War National
Scenario
Two Strands of National
Upsurge
Two basic strands of national upsurge can be identified during
the last two years of British rule—
(i) tortuous negotiations involving the government,
Congress and Muslim League, increasingly accompanied by
communal violence and culminating in freedom and the
partition.
(ii) sporadic, localised and often extremely militant and
united mass action by workers, peasants and states’ peoples
which took the form of a countrywide strike wave. This kind
of activity was occasioned by the INA Release Movement,
Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt, Tebhaga movement, Worli
revolt, Punjab Kisan Morchas, Travancore peoples’ struggle
(especially the Punnapra-Vayalar episode) and the Telangana
peasant revolt.

Change in Government’s
Attitude
When the government lifted the ban on the Congress and
released the Congress leaders in June 1945, they expected
to find a demoralised people. Instead, they found tumultuous
crowds impatient to do something. Popular energy resurfaced
after three years of repression. People’s expectations were
462

Post-War National Scenario

 463

heightened by the release of their leaders. The Wavell Plan
backed by the Conservative government in Britain failed to
break the constitutional deadlock.
In July 1945, Labour Party formed the government in
Britain. Clement Attlee took over as the new prime minister
and Pethick Lawrence as the new secretary of state for India.
In August 1945, elections to central and provincial
assemblies were announced.
In September 1945, it was announced that a constituent
assembly would be convened after the elections and that the
government was working according to the spirit of the Cripps
Offer.
The government’s change attitude was dictated by the
following factors.
1. The end of the War resulted in a change in balance
of global power—the UK was no more a big power while
the USA and USSR emerged as superpowers, both of which
favoured freedom for India.
2. The new Labour government was more sympathetic
to Indian demands.
3. Throughout Europe, there was a wave of socialistradical governments.
4. British soldiers were weary and tired and the British
economy lay shattered. (By 1945 the British government in
London owed India £1.2 billion and was being drained by the
US Lend-Lease agreement, which was finally paid off only
in 2006.)
5. There was an anti-imperialist wave in South-East
Asia—in Vietnam and Indonesia—resisting efforts to replant
French and Dutch rule there.
6. Officials feared another Congress revolt, a revival
of the 1942 situation but much more dangerous because of
a likely combination of attacks on communications, agrarian
revolts, labour trouble, army disaffection joined by government
officials and the police in the presence of INA men with
some military experience.
7. Elections were inevitable once the war ended since
the last elections had been held in 1934 for the Centre and
in 1937 for the provinces.
The British would have had to retreat; the Labour
government only quickened the process somewhat.

464  

Congress Election Campaign
and INA Trials
Elections were held in the winter of 1945-46.

Election Campaign for Nationalistic Aims

The most significant feature of the election campaign was
that it sought to mobilise the Indians against the British; it
did not just appeal to the people for votes.
The election campaign expressed the nationalist
sentiments against the state repression of the 1942 Quit India
upsurge. This was done by glorifying martyrs and condemning
officials. The brave resistance of the leaderless people was
lauded; martyrs’ memorials were set up; relief funds were
collected for sufferers; the officials responsible for causing
pain were condemned; and promises of enquiry and threats
of punishment to guilty officials were spelt out.
The government failed to check such speeches. This had
a devastating effect on the morale of the services. The
prospect of the return of Congress ministries, especially in
those provinces where repression had been most brutal,
further heightened the fears of those in government services.
A ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with the Congress seemed
necessary to the government.
Mass pressure against the trial of INA POWs, sometimes
described as “an edge of a volcano”, brought about a decisive
shift in the government’s policy. The British had initially
decided to hold public trials of several hundreds of INA
prisoners besides dismissing them from service and detaining
without trial around 7,000 of them. They compounded the
folly by holding the first trial at the Red Fort in Delhi in
November 1945 and putting on dock together a Hindu, Prem
Kumar Sehgal, a Muslim, Shah Nawaz Khan, and a Sikh,
Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon.
Another issue was provided by the use of Indian Army
units in a bid to restore French and Dutch colonial rule in
Vietnam and Indonesia: this enhanced the anti-imperialist
feeling among a section of urban population and the Army.

Post-War National Scenario

 465

Congress Support for INA Prisoners

● At the first post-War Congress session in September
1945 at Bombay, a strong resolution was adopted declaring
Congress support for the INA cause.
● Defence of INA prisoners in the court was organised
by Bhulabhai Desai, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Kailash Nath Katju,
Jawaharlal Nehru and Asaf Ali.
● INA Relief and Enquiry Committee distributed small
sums of money and food, and helped arrange employment
for the affected.
● Fund collection was organised.

The INA Agitation—A Landmark on
Many Counts

The high pitch and intensity at which the campaign for the
release of INA prisoners was conducted was unprecedented.
The agitation got wide publicity through extensive press
coverage with daily editorials, distribution of pamphlets often
containing threats of revenge, grafitti conveying similar
messages, holding of public meetings and celebrations of
INA Day (November 12, 1945) and INA week (November
5-11).
The campaign spread over a wide area of the country
and witnessed the participation of diverse social groups and
political parties. While the nerve centres of the agitation
were Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, United Provinces
towns and Punjab, the campaign spread to distant places such
as Coorg, Baluchistan and Assam. The forms of participation
included fund contributions made by many people—from
film stars, municipal committees, Indians living abroad and
gurudwaras to tongawallas; participation in meetings;
shopkeepers closing shops; political groups demanding release
of prisoners; contributing to INA funds; student meetings
and boycott of classes; organising kisan conferences; and All
India Women’s Conference demanding the release of INA
prisoners.
Those who supported the INA cause in varying degrees,
apart from the Congress, included the Muslim League,
Communist Party, Unionists, Akalis, Justice Party, Ahrars in
Rawalpindi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha
and the Sikh League.

466  

Pro-INA sentiments surfaced in traditional bulwarks of
the Raj. Government employees collected funds. The
loyalists—the gentlemen with titles—appealed to the
government to abandon the trials for good Indo-British
relations. Men of the armed forces were unexpectedly
sympathetic and attended meetings, received those released
(often in uniforms) and contributed funds.
The central theme became the questioning of Britain’s
right to decide a matter concerning Indians. Britain realised
the political significance of the INA issue, which with each
day assumed more and more of an ‘Indian versus British’
colour.

Three Upsurges—Winter of
1945-46
The nationalist sentiment which reached a crescendo around
the INA trials developed into violent confrontations with the
authority in the winter of 1945-46. There were three major
upsurges—
1. November 21, 1945—in Calcutta over the INA trials.
2. February 11, 1946—in Calcutta against the sevenyear sentence to INA officer Rashid Ali.
3. February 18, 1946—in Bombay, strike by the Royal
Indian Navy ratings.

Three-Stage Pattern

All three upsurges showed a similar three-stage pattern.
Stage I. When a Group Defies Authority
and is Repressed
In the first instance of this stage (November 21, 1945), a
student procession comprising some Forward Bloc
sympathisers, Student Federation of India (SFI) activists and
Islamia College students, who had joined up with the League
and the Congress, tied flags as a symbol of anti-imperialist
unity, marched to Dalhousie Square—the seat of government
in Calcutta. These protestors refused to disperse and were
lathicharged. They retaliated by throwing stones and brickbats.
The police resorted to firing in which two persons died.

Post-War National Scenario

In the next step (February 11, 1946), the protest was
led by Muslim League students in which some Congress and
communist students’ organisations joined. Some arrests
provoked the students to defy Section 144. There were more
arrests and the agitating students were lathicharged.
Rebellion by Naval Ratings On February 18, 1946
some 1100 Royal Indian Navy (RIN) ratings of HMIS Talwar
went on a strike to protest against
* racial discrimination (demanding equal pay for Indian
and white soldiers)
* unpalatable food
* abuse by superior officers
* arrest of a rating for scrawling ‘Quit India’ on HMIS
Talwar
* INA trials
* use of Indian troops in Indonesia, demanding their
withdrawal.
The rebellious ratings hoisted the tricolour, crescent,
and the hammer and sickle flags on the mast of the rebel
fleet. Other ratings soon joined and they went around Bombay
in lorries holding Congress flags threatening Europeans and
policemen. Crowds brought food to the ratings and shopkeepers invited them to take whatever they needed.
Stage II. When the City People Join In
This phase was marked by a virulent anti-British mood
resulting in the virtual paralysis of Calcutta and Bombay.
There were meetings, processions, strikes, hartals, and attacks
on Europeans, police stations, shops, tram depots, railway
stations, banks, besides stopping of rail and road traffic by
squatting on tracks and barricading of streets.
Stage III. When People in Other Parts of the
Country Express Sympathy and Solidarity
While the students boycotted classes and organised hartals
and processions to express sympathy with other students and
the ratings, there were sympathetic strikes in military
establishments in Karachi, Madras, Visakhapatnam, Calcutta,
Delhi, Cochin, Jamnagar, Andamans, Bahrain and Aden. There
were strikes by the Royal Indian Air Force in Bombay, Poona,
Calcutta, Jessore and Ambala.

468  

Patel and Jinnah persuaded the ratings to surrender on
February 23 with an assurance that national parties would
prevent any victimisation.

Evaluation of Potential and Impact of the
Three Upsurges

The three upsurges were significant in many ways:
● Fearless action by the masses was an expression of
militancy in the popular mind.
● Revolt in the armed forces had a great liberating
effect on the minds of people.
● The RIN revolt was seen as an event marking the end
of British rule.
● These upsurges prompted the British to extend some
concessions:
(i) On December 1, 1946, the government announced
that only those INA members accused of murder or brutal
treatment of fellow prisoners would be brought to trial.
(ii) Imprisonment sentences passed against the first
batch were remitted in January 1947.
(iii) Indian soldiers were withdrawn from Indo-China
and Indonesia by February 1947.
(iv) The decision to send a parliamentary delegation to
India (November 1946) was taken.
(v) The decision to send Cabinet Mission was taken in
January 1946.
But could the communal unity witnessed during these
events, if built upon, have offered a way out of the communal
deadlock? Or, in other words, what was the potential of these
upsurges?
These upsurges were in the nature of direct and violent
conflict with authority, which had obvious limitations. Only
the more militant sections could participate.
These upsurges were short-lived and were confined to
a few urban centres while the general INA agitation reached
the remotest villages.
Communal unity witnessed was more organisational
than a unity among the people. Muslim ratings went to the
League to seek advice and the rest to the Congress and the
Socialists.

Post-War National Scenario

 469

Despite considerable erosion of the morale of the
bureaucracy, the British infrastructure to repress was intact.
They were soon able to control the situation. It was a Maratha
battalion in Bombay that rounded up the ratings and restored
them to their barracks.

Congress Strategy

The leftists claim that the Congress indifference to the
revolutionary situation arose because of two considerations—
that the situation would go out of its control and that a
disciplined armed forces were vital in a free India. They also
claim that if the Congress leaders had not surrendered to
power play, a different path to independence would have
emerged. But actually these upsurges were an extension of
earlier nationalist activity fostered by the Congress through
its election campaign, its advocacy of the INA cause and
highlighting of the excesses of 1942.
These upsurges were distinguishable from the earlier
activity because of their form of articulation. These were
violent challenges to the authority while the earlier activity
was a peaceful demonstration of national solidarity.
The Congress did not officially support these upsurges
because of their tactics and timing.
Negotiations had been an integral part of the Congress
strategy, to be explored before a mass movement could be
launched, especially when the British were seen to be
preparing to leave soon.
In Gandhi’s opinion, the mutiny was badly advised: if
they mutinied for India’s freedom, they were doubly wrong;
if they had any grievances, they should have waited for the
guidance of leaders.

Election Results
Performance of the Congress

It got 91 per cent of non-Muslim votes.
It captured 57 out of 102 seats in the Central
Assembly.
● In the provincial elections, it got a majority in most
provinces except in Bengal, Sindh and Punjab. The Congress
majority provinces included the NWFP and Assam which
were being claimed for Pakistan.
●
●

470  

Muslim League’s Performance

It got 86.6 per cent of the Muslim votes.
It captured the 30 reserved seats in the Central
Assembly.
● In the provincial elections, it got a majority in Bengal
and Sindh.
● Unlike in 1937, now the League clearly established
itself as the dominant party among Muslims.
In Punjab A Unionist-Congress-Akali coalition under
Khizr Hayat Khan assumed power.

Significant Features of Elections

The elections witnessed communal voting in contrast to the
strong anti-British unity shown in various upsurges due to
1. separate electorates; and
2. limited franchise—for the provinces, less than 10
per cent of the population could vote and for the Central
Assembly, less than 1 per cent of the population was eligible.

The Cabinet Mission
The Attlee government announced in February 1946 the
decision to send a high-powered mission of three British
cabinet members (Pethick Lawrence, Secretary of State for
India; Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade; and
A.V. Alexander, First Lord of Admiralty) to India to find out
ways and means for a negotiated, peaceful transfer of power
to India. (Pethick Lawrence was the chairman of the mission.)

Why British Withdrawal Seemed
Imminent Now
1. The success of nationalist forces in the struggle for
hegemony was fairly evident by the end of the War.
Nationalism had penetrated into hitherto untouched sections
and areas.
2. There was a demonstration in favour of nationalism
among the bureaucracy and the loyalist sections; because the
paucity of European ICS recruits and a policy of Indianisation
had ended the British domination of the ICS as early as the
First World War and by 1939, there existed a British-Indian
parity. The long war had caused weariness and economic

Post-War National Scenario

 471

worries. Now only a depleted, war-weary bureaucracy battered
by the 1942 events remained.
3. The British strategy of conciliation and repression
had its limitations and contradictions.
● After the Cripps’ Offer there was little left to offer
for conciliation except full freedom.
● When non-violent resistance was repressed with
force, the naked force behind the government stood exposed,
while if the government did not clamp down on ‘sedition’
or made offers for truce, it was seen to be unable to wield
authority, and its prestige suffered.
● Efforts to woo the Congress dismayed the loyalists.
This policy of an unclear mix presented a dilemma for
the services, who nevertheless had to implement it. The
prospect of Congress ministries coming to power in the
provinces further compounded this dilemma.
4. Constitutionalism or Congress Raj had proved to be
a big morale-booster and helped in deeper penetration of
patriotic sentiments among the masses.
5. Demands of leniency for INA prisoners from within
the Army and the revolt of the RIN ratings had raised fears
that the armed forces may not be as reliable if the Congress
started a 1942-type mass movement, this time aided by the
provincial ministries.
6. The only alternative to an all-out repression of a
mass movement was an entirely official rule which seemed
impossible now because the necessary numbers and efficient
officials were not available.
Views
The British Cabinet saw the growing rift between the Congress
and the Muslim League as their trump card... Both Linlithgow
and the Cabinet looked to the rivalry of the Congress and the
League as their most useful weapon against the demands of
either.
B.R. Tomlinson
Our time in India is limited and our power to control events almost
gone. We have only prestige and previous momentum to trade
on and these will not last long.
Lord Wavell (October 1946)

472  

7. The government realised that a settlement was
necessary for burying the ghost of a mass movement and for
good future Indo-British relations.
Now the overarching aim of the British policy-makers
was a graceful withdrawal, after a settlement on the modalities
of the transfer of power and nature of post-imperial IndiaBritain relations.

On the Eve of Cabinet Mission Plan

The Congress demanded that power be transferred to one
centre and that minorities’ demands be worked out in a
framework ranging from autonomy to Muslim-majority
provinces to self-determination or secession from the Indian
Union—but, only after the British left.
The British bid for a united and friendly India and an
active partner in defence of the Commonwealth, because a
divided India would lack in defence and would be a blot on
Britain’s diplomacy.
The British policy in 1946 clearly reflected a preference
for a united India, in sharp contrast to earlier declarations.
On March 15, 1946, the Prime Minister of Britain, Clement
Attlee said: “...though mindful of the rights of minorities...
cannot allow a minority to place their veto on advance of
the majority.” This was a far cry from the Shimla Conference
where Wavell had allowed Jinnah to wreck the conference.

Cabinet Mission Arrives

The Cabinet Mission reached Delhi on March 24, 1946. It
had prolonged discussions with Indian leaders of all parties
and groups on the issues of
(i) interim government; and
(ii) principles and procedures for framing a new
constitution giving freedom to India.
As the Congress and the League could not come to any
agreement on the fundamental issue of the unity or partition
of India, the mission put forward its own plan for the solution
of the constitutional problem in May 1946.

Post-War National Scenario

 473

(i) the Pakistan so formed would include a large nonMuslim population—38 per cent in the North-West
and 48 per cent in the North-East;
(ii) the very principle of communal self-determination
would claim separation of Hindu-majority western
Bengal and Sikh- and Hindu-dominated Ambala and
Jullundur divisions of Punjab (already some Sikh
leaders were demanding a separate state if the
country was partitioned);
(iii) deep-seated regional ties would be disturbed if
Bengal and Punjab were partitioned;
(iv) partition would entail economic and administrative
problems, for instance, the problem of
communication between the western and eastern
parts of Pakistan; and
(v) the division of the armed forces would be dangerous.
● Grouping of existing provincial assemblies into three
sections:
Section-A: Madras, Bombay, Central Provinces, United
Provinces, Bihar and Orissa (Hindu-majority provinces)
Section-B: Punjab, North-West Frontier Province and
Sindh (Muslim-majority provinces)
Section-C: Bengal and Assam (Muslim-majority
provinces).
● Three-tier executive and legislature at provincial,
section and union levels.
● A constituent assembly was to be elected by provincial
assemblies by proportional representation (voting in three
groups—General, Muslims, Sikhs). This constituent assembly
would be a 389-member body with provincial assemblies
sending 292, chief commissioner’s provinces sending 4, and
princely states sending 93 members.
(This was a good, democratic method not based on
weightage.)
● In the constituent assembly, members from groups
A, B and C were to sit separately to decide the constitution
for provinces and if possible, for the groups also. Then, the
whole constituent assembly (all three sections A, B and C
combined) would sit together to formulate the union
constitution.

474  
● A common centre would control defence,
communication and external affairs. A federal structure was
envisaged for India.
● Communal questions in the central legislature were
to be decided by a simple majority of both communities
present and voting.
● Provinces were to have full autonomy and residual
powers.
● Princely states were no longer to be under paramountcy
of the British government. They would be free to enter into
an arrangement with successor governments or the British
government.
● After the first general elections, a province was to
be free to come out of a group and after 10 years, a province
was to be free to call for a reconsideration of the group or
the union constitution.
● Meanwhile, an interim government was to be formed
from the constituent assembly.

Different Interpretations of the Grouping
Clause

Each party or group looked at the plan from its own point
of view.
Congress: To the Congress, the Cabinet Mission Plan
was against the creation of Pakistan since grouping was
optional; one constituent assembly was envisaged; and the
League no longer had a veto.
Muslim League: The Muslim League believed Pakistan
to be implied in compulsory grouping. (The Mission later
clarified that the grouping was compulsory.)

Main Objections

Different parties objected to the Plan on different grounds.
Congress ● Provinces should not have to wait till the
first general elections to come out of a group. They should
have the option of not joining a group in the first place.
(Congress had the Congress-ruled provinces of NWFP and
Assam in mind which had been included in groups B and C
respectively.)
● Compulsory grouping contradicts the oft-repeated
insistence on provincial autonomy.

Post-War National Scenario

 475

● Absence of provision for elected members from the
princely states in the constituent assembly (they could only
be nominated by the princes) was not acceptable.
League ● Grouping should be compulsory with sections
B and C developing into solid entities with a view to future
secession into Pakistan.
The League had thought that the Congress would reject
the plan, thus prompting the government to invite the League
to form the interim government.

Acceptance and Rejection

The Muslim League on June 6 and the Congress on June 24,
1946 accepted the long-term plan put forward by the Cabinet
Mission.
July 1946 Elections were held in provincial assemblies
for the Constituent Assembly.
July 10, 1946 Nehru stated, “We are not bound by a
single thing except that we have decided to go into the
Constituent Assembly (implying that the Constituent Assembly
was sovereign and would decide the rules of procedure). The
big probability is that there would be no grouping as NWFP
and Assam would have objections to joining sections B
and C.”
July 29, 1946 The League withdrew its acceptance of
the long-term plan in response to Nehru’s statement and gave
a call for “direct action” from August 16 to achieve
Pakistan.
Wavell’s ‘Breakdown Plan’
Wavell presented his plan to the Cabinet Mission in May 1946.
It visualised a middle course between “repression” and “scuttle”.
This plan envisaged the withdrawal of the British Army and
officials to the Muslim provinces of North-West and North-East
and handing over the rest of the country to the Congress. Though
superseded by the Cabinet Mission Plan, Wavell’s plan was an
evidence of
● British recognition of the impossibility of suppressing any
future Congress-led rebellion.
● desire in some high official circles to make a “Northern
Ireland” of Pakistan.

476  

Communal Holocaust and the
Interim Government
From August 16, 1946, the Indian scene was rapidly
transformed. There were communal riots on an unprecedented
scale, which left around several thousands dead.
The worst-hit areas were Calcutta, Bombay, Noakhali,
Bihar and Garhmukteshwar (United Provinces).

Changed Government Priorities

Wavell was now eager to somehow get the Congress into
the Interim Government, even if the League stayed out (a
departure from Wavell’s stand during the Shimla conference).
This attitude was against the League’s insistence that all
settlements be acceptable to it and also against earlier
government postures of encouraging communal forces, of
denying the legitimacy of nationalism, and of denying the
representative nature of Congress.
Thus, continuance of British rule had demanded one
stance from Britain, and the withdrawal and post-imperial
links dictated a contrary posture.

Interim Government

Fearing mass action by the Congress, a Congress-dominated
Interim Government headed by Nehru was sworn in on
September 2, 1946 with Nehru continuing to insist on his
party’s opposition to the compulsory grouping.
Despite the title, the Interim Government was little
more than a continuation of the old executive of the viceroy
(Wavell overruled the ministers on the issue of the release
of INA prisoners in his very last cabinet meeting in March
1947).
Wavell quietly brought the Muslim League into the
Interim Government on October 26, 1946. The League was
allowed to join
● without giving up the ‘direct action’;
● despite its rejection of the Cabinet Mission’s longterm and short-term plans; and
● despite insistence on compulsory grouping with
decisions being taken by a majority vote by a section

as a whole (which would reduce the opponents of
Pakistan in Assam and NWFP to a position of
helpless minority).

Obstructionist Approach and Ulterior
Motives of the League

The League did not attend the Constituent Assembly which
had its first meeting on December 9, 1946. Consequently,
the Assembly had to confine itself to passing a general
‘Objectives Resolution’ drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru stating
the ideals of an independent sovereign republic with
autonomous units, adequate minority safeguards and social,
political and economic democracy.
The League refused to attend informal meetings of the
cabinet to take decisions.
The League questioned the decisions and appointments
made by the Congress members.
Liaqat Ali Khan as the finance minister restricted and
encumbered the efficient functioning of other ministries.
The League had only sought a foothold in the government

478  

to fight for Pakistan. For them, it was a continuation of the
civil war by other means. The Congress demand that the
British get the League to change its attitude in the Interim
Government or quit was voiced ever since the League joined
the Interim Government.
In February 1947, nine Congress members of the
cabinet wrote to the viceroy demanding the resignation of
League members and threatening the withdrawal of their own
nominees. The last straw came with the League demanding
the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. A crisis seemed
to be developing rapidly.

Birth and Spread of
Communalism in India
With the rise of nationalism, communalism appeared around
the end of the nineteenth century. It proved to be a huge threat
to the unity of the Indian people and the national movement.
The legacy, unfortunately continues.

Characteristic Features of Indian
Communalism

Communalism (more accurately ‘sectarianism’) is basically
an ideology, which gives more importance to one’s own
ethnic/religious group rather than to the wider society as a
whole, evolved through three broad stages in India.
(i) Communal Nationalism: the notion that since a
group or a section of people belong to a particular religious
community, their secular interests are the same, i.e., even
those matters which have got nothing to do with religion
affect all of them equally.
(ii) Liberal Communalism: the notion that since two
religious communities have different religious interests, they
have different interests in the secular sphere also (i.e., in
economic, political and cultural spheres).
(iii) Extreme Communalism: the notion that not only
do different religious communities have different interests,
but also that these interests are incompatible, i.e., two
communities cannot co-exist because the interests of one
community come into conflict with those of the other.

Post-War National Scenario

 479

There is nothing unique about Indian communalism. It
was the result of the conditions which have, in other
societies, produced similar phenomena and ideologies such
as Fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, the Catholic-Protestant
conflict in Northern Ireland and the Christian-Muslim conflict
in Lebanon.
Bypassing basic economic interests, the communalists
claim to protect interests which do not necessarily exist.
Communalism is a modern phenomenon—rooted in the
modern social, economic and political colonial structure—
that emerged out of modern politics based on mass
mobilisation and popular participation. Modern politics made
it necessary for people to have wider links and loyalties and
to form establish identities. This process involved the spread
of modern ideas of nation, class and cultural-linguistic
identity. In India, religious consciousness was transformed
into communal consciousness in some parts of the country
and among some sections of the people.
Its social roots lay in the rising middle classes who
propagated imaginary communal interests to further their own
economic interests—communalism was a bourgeois question
par excellence, according to the Left.
Communalists were backed in their communal campaign
by the colonial administration. It was the channel through
which colonialists expanded their social base.
Communalists and colonialists were helped in their
sinister motives by the fact that often socio-economic
distinctions in Indian society coincided with religious
distinctions. The inherent class contradictions were given a
post-facto communal colouring by the vested interests.
Conservative social reactionary elements gave full
support to communalism.
Religiosity itself did not amount to communalism but
in a country where lack of education and low awareness of
the outside world was a sad reality, religion had the potential
of becoming, and was used as, a vehicle of communalism.

Reasons for Growth of Communalism

Communalism grew in the modern economic, political and
social institutions where new identities were emerging in a

480  

haphazard manner even as the old, pre-modern identities had
not diminished. A clash of this fundamental dichotomy gave
rise to a communal ideology.
Socio-economic Reasons
Religion did not actually dictate the economic and political
interests of the Hindus and Muslims. One community
(consisting of Hindus as well as Muslims) differed from
another (also consisting of Hindus and Muslims) by language,
culture, caste, social status, food and dress habits, social
practices or customs and so on. Even socially and culturally
the Hindu and the Muslim masses had developed common
ways of life: a Bengali Muslim has much more in common
with a Bengali Hindu than with a Punjabi Muslim. Moreover,
Hindus and the Muslims were equal victims of oppression
and exploitation by British imperialism.
Modern Western thought and scientific ideas were not
absorbed by Muslim intellectuals, who remained traditional
and backward. Even when, as a result of the efforts of
reformers, modern education spread among Muslims, the
proportion of the educated was far lower among Muslims
than among Hindus, Parsis or Christians. The Muslims also
lagged behind as participants in the growth of trade and
industry. As the number of educated persons and men of trade
and industry among the Muslims was rather small, it was easy
for the reactionary big landlords and the richer classes to
continue to wield influence over the Muslim masses. Landlords
and zamindars, whether Hindu or Muslim, supported the
British rule out of self-interest. But, among the Hindus, the
modern intellectuals and the rising commercial and industrialist
class had taken over the leadership from the old order of
landlords.
The educated Muslims found few opportunities in
business or the professions; they inevitably looked for
government employment. The British officials and the loyalist
Muslim leaders incited the educated Muslims against the
educated Hindus. Syed Ahmad Khan and others demanded
special treatment for the Muslims in the matter of government
service, on the one hand, and on the other told the Muslims
that if the educated Muslims remained loyal to the British,

Post-War National Scenario

 481

the latter would reward them with government jobs and other
special favours. The same arguments were used by some
loyalist Hindus and Parsis with regard to their people, but
they were in a small minority.
As a result of the underdevelopment due to colonial
policies, there was a lack of industrial development; hence,
unemployment was an acute problem in India, especially for
the educated, and there was an intense competition for
existing jobs. In the circumstances there were advocates of
short-sighted and short-term solutions such as reservation in
jobs on communal, provincial or caste lines. These persons
aroused communal and religious and, later, caste and provincial
passions in an attempt to get a larger share of the existing,
limited employment opportunities. It was easy for those
desperately searching for jobs for employment to fall prey
to such ideas.
Because of the economic backwardness of India and
rampant unemployment, there was ample scope for the
colonial government to use concessions, favours and
reservations to fuel communal and separatist tendencies.
Also, modern political consciousness was late in developing
among the Muslims and the dominance of traditional
reactionary elements over the Muslim masses helped a
communal outlook to take root.
There was talk of Hindu nationalism and Muslim
nationalism. Politically immature, many Hindus as well as
Views
There has been a difference of a generation or more in the
development of the Hindu and the Muslim middle classes, and
that difference continues to show itself in many directions,
political, economic, and other. It is this lag which produces a
psychology of fear among the Muslims.
Jawaharlal Nehru in The Discovery of India
He who does what is beneficial to the people of this country,
be he a Muhammedan or an Englishman, is not alien. ‘Alienness’
has to do with interests. Alienness is certainly not concerned
with white or black skin or religion.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak

482  

Muslims did not realise that the economic, educational and
cultural difficulties they were experiencing were born out of
their subjection to foreign rule and because of economic
underdevelopment.
British Policy of Divide and Rule
Muslims were generally looked upon with suspicion initially,
especially after the Wahabi and 1857 revolts, and were
subjected to repression and discrimination by the British
government. Also, the introduction of English education had
undermined Arabic and Persian learning which added further
to the economic backwardness and exclusion of the Muslims
from service.
After the 1870s, with signs of the emergence of Indian
nationalism and growing politicisation of the educated middle
classes, the government reversed its policy of repression of
Muslims and, instead, decided to rally them behind the
government through concessions, favours and reservations,
and used them against nationalist forces. The government
used persons like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to counter the
growing influence of the Congress. Syed Ahmed Khan had
a broadminded and reformist outlook initially but later he
started supporting the colonial government, exhorting the
Muslim masses to stay away from the Congress and not to
get politicised. He also started talking of separate interests
of Hindus and Muslims.
Communalism in History Writing
Initially suggested by imperialist historians and later adopted
by some chauvinist Indian historians, the communal
interpretation of Indian history portrayed the ancient phase
as the Hindu phase and the medieval phase (which included
the rule of the Turks, the Afghans and the Mughals) as the
Muslim phase. The conflicts of ruling classes during the
medieval phase were distorted and exaggerated as HinduMuslim conflicts.
Historians ignored the fact that politics, ancient and
medieval as of all times and anywhere, was based on
economic and political interests and not on religious
considerations. It was in the interests of the British and
communal historians to refuse to acknowledge the notion of

Post-War National Scenario

 483

View
Communal harmony could not be permanently established in our
country so long as highly distorted versions of history were taught
in her schools and colleges, through the history textbooks.
M.K. Gandhi

a composite culture in India. On its part, the Hindu communal
view of history chose to project the view that Indian society
and culture had reached ideal heights in the ancient period
from which they began to decay in the medieval period
because of ‘Muslim’ rule. In this, there was a refusal to
acknowledge how Indian economy and technology, religion
and philosophy, arts and literature, culture and society had
developed and been enriched in the medieval period.
Side-effects of Socio-religious Reform Movements
Reform movements such as the Wahabi Movement among
Muslims and Shuddhi among Hindus with their militant
overtones made the role of religion more vulnerable to
communalism. Reforms, at times, were seen as a process of
insulating one community from the influence of another
religious community.
Side-effects of Militant Nationalism
The early nationalists made conscious efforts to remove
minority fears. Dadabhai Naoroji, presiding over the second
Congress session (1886), declared the intentions of the
Congress not to raise socio-religious questions in its forums.
In 1889 the Congress decided not to take up any issue
opposed by the Muslims. But later, with the coming of
militant nationalism, a distinct Hindu nationalist tinge was
palpable in the nationalist politics. For instance, Tilak’s
Ganapati and Shivaji festivals and anti-cow slaughter campaigns
created much suspicion. Aurobindo’s vision of an Aryanised
world, the Swadeshi Movement with elements like dips in
the Ganga and revolutionary activity with oath-taking before
goddesses were hardly likely to enthuse Muslims into these
campaigns in a big way. The communal element in the
Lucknow Pact (1916) and the Khilafat agitation (1920-22)
was too visible to be of insignificant consequences.

484  

When the Khilafat question came up, there was unease
among some Congressmen who felt that the issue was not
really nationalistic. The fight against imperialistic Britain in
this case was not about the economic and political
consequences of imperialism, but on the ground that the
Caliph and some holy places of Islam were being threatened.
The Muslims’ sympathy for Turkey was on religious grounds.
Even later, the heroes and myths and cultural traditions the
Muslims appealed to belonged not to the history of India but
to the history of West Asia. Though this tendency did not
immediately clash with Indian nationalism, but in fact made
its supporters anti-imperialist, in the longer term, it encouraged
the habit of looking at political questions from a religious
point of view.
Communal Reaction by Majority Community
The minority communalism met with a reaction from the
majority community. From the 1870s itself, some Hindu
zamindars, moneylenders and middle-class professionals began
to give expression to anti-Muslim sentiments. They went to
the extent of declaring that the British had liberated the land
from Muslim tyranny and saved the Hindus from the oppression
by Muslims. The cause of Hindi was given a communal colour
by saying that Urdu was the language of the Muslims (which
was not historically quite correct).
Then came organisations to promote a communal
outlook. The Punjab Hindu Sabha, founded in 1909 by U.N.
Mukherjee and Lal Chand, opposed the Congress for trying
to unite Indians of all colours into a single nation. They
argued that Hindus should side with the colonial government
in their fight against Muslims. The All-India Hindu Mahasabha
held its first session in April 1915 with the Maharaja of
Kasim Bazar as president. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
(RSS) was established in 1925. However, Hindu communalism
was not a strong force for a long time as the modern secular
intelligentsia and middle class among Hindus wielded a
greater influence. This was not the case with the Muslims;
the Muslim communal elements – landlords, traditional
religious leaders and bureaucrats – exercised a lot of
influence on the Muslims.

Post-War National Scenario

The one-upmanship of different versions of communal
tendencies was a factor which deterred any effective counteroffensive against communalism.

Evolution of the Two-Nation Theory

The development of the two-nation theory over the years is
as follows:
1887: There was a frontal attack on the Congress by
Dufferin, the viceroy, and Colvin, the Lt. Governor of the
United Provinces. Syed Ahmed Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad
of Bhinga were propped up as an anti-Congress front by the
government. Syed Ahmed Khan appealed to the educated
Muslims to stay away from the Congress, although some
Muslims did join the Congress. These included Badruddin
Tyabji, Mir Musharraf Hussain, A. Bhimji and Hamid Ali
Khan.
1906: Agha Khan led a Muslim delegation (called the
Shimla delegation) to the viceroy, Lord Minto, to demand
separate electorates for Muslims at all levels and that the
Muslim representation should be commensurate not only
with their numerical strength but also with their “political
importance and their contribution to the British Empire”.
Minto assured them of special communal representation in
excess of their population for their “extraordinary service”
to the empire.
The All India Muslim League was founded by the Agha
Khan, Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk
and Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk to preach loyalty to the British
government and to keep the Muslim intelligentsia away from
the Congress.
1909: Separate electorates were awarded under MorleyMinto Reforms.
Punjab Hindu Sabha was founded by U.N. Mukherji and
Lal Chand.
1915: First session of All India Hindu Mahasabha was
held under the aegis of the Maharaja of Kasim Bazar.
1912-24: During this period, the Muslim League was
dominated by younger Muslim nationalists, but their
nationalism was inspired by a communal view of political
questions.

486  

1916: The Congress accepted the Muslim League
demand of separate electorates and the Congress and the
League presented joint demands to the government. But the
Congress and the League came together as separate political
entities and the Congress gave political legitimacy to the
existence of the Muslim League.
1920-22: Muslims participated in the Rowlatt and
Khilafat Non-Cooperation agitations but there was a communal
element in the political outlook of the Muslims.
1920s: The shadow of communal riots loomed large
over the country. The Arya Samajists started Shuddhi
(purification) and Sangathan (organisation) movements. The
Shuddhi movement was aimed at reconverting to Hinduism
those who had converted to Islam. The Muslims started the
Tabligh and Tanzeem movements in retaliation.
Some nationalists also turned communal. The Swarajists
were divided along communal lines and many of the
Responsivists among them joined the Hindu Mahasabha. The
Ali brothers, after having put up a spectacular united front
with the Congress, accused the Congress of protecting only
Hindu interests.
The Congress failed to evolve a suitable strategy to
counter the rise of communalism.
1928: The Nehru Report on constitutional reforms as
suggested by the Congress was opposed by Muslim hardliners
and the Sikh League. Jinnah proposed fourteen points
demanding separate electorates and reservation for Muslims
in government service and self-governing bodies. By
negotiating with the Muslim League, the Congress made a
number of mistakes:
1. It gave legitimacy to the politics of the League, thus
giving recognition to the division of society into separate
communities with separate interests.
2. It undermined the role of secular, nationalist Muslims.
3. Concessions to one community prompted other
communities to demand similar concessions.
4. Launching an all-out attack on communalism became
difficult.
1930-34: Some Muslim groups, such as the Jamaat-

Post-War National Scenario

 487

i-ulema-i-Hind, State of Kashmir and Khudai Khidmatgars
participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement but overall
the participation of Muslims was nowhere near the level of
the Khilafat agitation. While the Congress stayed away from
two of the three round table conferences held in London to
discuss further constitutional reforms, the communalists
attended all three of them.
1932: The Communal Award accepted all Muslim
communal demands contained in the 14 points.
After 1937: After the Muslim League performed badly
in the 1937 provincial elections, it decided to resort to
extreme communalism. There began a tendency to project
the Muslims, not as a minority but as a separate nation (in
the early 1930s this idea of a separate Muslim nation was
proposed by a young Muslim intellectual Rahmat Ali and later
developed further by the poet Iqbal). From now onwards,
communalism was organised as a mass movement with its
base among middle and upper classes. Vicious propaganda
was launched against the Congress by Z.A. Suleri, F.M.
Durrani, Fazl-ul-Haq, etc. Extreme communalism was based
on fear, hatred and violence of word and deed.
Till 1937 there had been liberal communalism, centred
around safeguards and reservations. It was communal while
upholding certain liberal, democratic, humanistic and
nationalistic values and the notion that these diverse
communities could be welded together into one nation in one
national interest.
The extreme communalism of Muslims found its echo
in the militant communal nationalism of Hindus represented
by organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha and RSS and
in the thoughts of leaders like Golwalkar. There were several
reasons for the advent of extreme communalism.
1. With increasing radicalisation, the reactionary
elements searched for a social base through channels of
communalism.
2. The colonial administration had exhausted all other
means to divide nationalists.
3. Earlier failures to challenge communal tendencies
had emboldened the communal forces.

at the Lahore session of the Muslim League calling for
“grouping of all geographically contiguous Muslim majority
areas (mainly north-western and eastern India) into independent
states in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and
sovereign, and adequate safeguards to Muslims in other areas
where they are in a minority”.
During Second World War The British India
Government gave a virtual veto to the League on political
settlement. The League made full use of this privilege and
stuck to its demand of a separate Pakistan throughout the
negotiations under the August Offer, Cripps’ proposals,
Shimla Conference and Cabinet Mission Plan. Finally, it got
what it had aspired for—an independent Pakistan comprising
Muslim majority areas of Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, NorthWest Frontier Province and Bengal in 1947.

Chapter 25

Independence with
Partition
Attlee’s Statement of February 20,
1947
Clement Attlee, the British prime minister, sensing the
trouble all around, made an announcement on February 20,
1947. The British House of Commons declared the British
intention of leaving the Indian subcontinent.

Main Points of Attlee’s Statement

● A deadline of June 30, 1948 was fixed for transfer
of power even if the Indian politicians had not agreed by that
time on the constitution.
● The British would relinquish power either to some
form of central government or in some areas to the existing
provincial governments if the constituent assembly was not
fully representative, i.e., if the Muslim majority provinces
did not join.
● British powers and obligations vis-a-vis the princely
states would lapse with transfer of power, but these would
not be transferred to any successor government in British
India.
● Mountbatten would replace Wavell as the viceroy.
The statement contained clear hints of partition and

491

492  

even Balkanisation of the country into numerous states and
was, in essence, a reversion of the Cripps Offer.

Why a Date Fixed by Government for
Withdrawal

● The government hoped that a fixed date would shock
the parties into an agreement on the main question.
● The government was keen to avert the developing
constitutional crisis.
● The government hoped to convince the Indians of
British sincerity.
● The truth in Wavell’s assessment could no longer be
denied—that an irreversible decline of the government’s
authority had taken place.

Congress Stand

The provision of transfer of power to more than one centre
was acceptable to Congress because it meant that the existing
assembly could go ahead and frame a constitution for the
areas represented by it, and it offered a way out of the
existing deadlock.
But the illusory hopes of a settlement were soon
shattered as the statement proved to be a prelude to the final
showdown. The League launched a civil disobedience
movement to overthrow the coalition government in Punjab,
as it felt emboldened by the statement.

Independence and Partition
The communal riots and the unworkability of the CongressLeague coalition compelled many in early 1947 to think in
terms of accepting the so far unthinkable idea of partition.
The most insistent demand now came from the Hindu and
Sikh communal groups in Bengal and Punjab who were
alarmed at the prospect of compulsory grouping which might
find them in Pakistan. The Hindu Mahasabha in Bengal was
assessing the feasibility of a separate Hindu province in West
Bengal.
On March 10, 1947, Nehru stated that the Cabinet
Mission’s was the best solution if carried out; the only real
alternative was the partition of Punjab and Bengal.

Independence with Partition

 493

In April 1947, the Congress president, Kripalani,
communicated to the viceroy— “... rather than have a battle,
we shall let them have their Pakistan provided you allow
Bengal and Punjab to be partitioned in a fair manner.”

Mountbatten as the Viceroy

Mountbatten proved more firm and quick in taking decisions
than his predecessors because he was informally given more
powers to decide things on the spot. He also had the
advantage of the firm decision of the British government to
quit at the earliest. His task was to explore the options of
unity and division till October 1947 and then advise the
British government on the form of transfer of power. But
he soon discovered that the broad contours of the scenario
to emerge were discernible even before he came to India.
The Cabinet Mission Plan was a dead horse and Jinnah was
obstinate about not settling for anything less than a sovereign
state. But a serious attempt at unity would involve supporting
those forces which wanted a unified India and countering
those who opposed it. Mountbatten preferred to woo both
sides.

Mountbatten Plan, June 3, 1947

The freedom-with-partition formula was coming to be widely
accepted well before Mountbatten arrived in India. One major
innovation (actually suggested by V.P. Menon) was the
immediate transfer of power on the basis of grant of
dominion status (with a right of secession), thus obviating
the need to wait for an agreement in the constituent assembly
on a new political structure.
Main Points
The important points of the plan were as follows.
● Punjab and Bengal Legislative Assemblies would
meet in two groups, Hindus and Muslims, to vote for
partition. If a simple majority of either group voted for
partition, then these provinces would be partitioned.
● In case of partition, two dominions and two constituent assemblies would be created.
● Sindh would take its own decision.
● Referendums in NWFP and Sylhet district of Bengal
would decide the fate of these areas.

494  
View
There is, however, no basis for the claim that the Civil
Disobedience Movement directly led to independence. The
campaigns of Gandhi … came to an ignoble end about fourteen
years before India achieved independence … During the First
World War the Indian revolutionaries sought to take advantage
of German help in the shape of war materials to free the country
by armed revolt. But the attempt did not succeed. During the
Second World War Subhas Bose followed the same method and
created the INA. In spite of brilliant planning and initial success,
the violent campaigns of Subhas Bose failed … The Battles
for India’s freedom were also being fought against Britain, though
indirectly, by Hitler in Europe and Japan in Asia. None of these
scored direct success, but few would deny that it was the
cumulative effect of all the three that brought freedom to India.
In particular, the revelations made by the INA trial, and the
reaction it produced in India, made it quite plain to the British,
already exhausted by the war, that they could no longer depend
upon the loyalty of the sepoys for maintaining their authority
in India. This had probably the greatest influence upon their final
decision to quit India.
R.C. Mazumdar
● Since the Congress had conceded a unified India, all
their other points would be met, namely,
(i) independence for princely states ruled out—they
would join either India or Pakistan;
(ii) independence for Bengal ruled out;
(iii) accession of Hyderabad to Pakistan ruled out
(Mountbatten supported the Congress on this);
(iv) freedom to come on August 15, 1947; and
(v) a boundary commission to be set up if partition was
to be effected.
Thus, the League’s demand was conceded to the extent
that Pakistan would be created and the Congress’ position
on unity was taken into account to make Pakistan as small
as possible. Mountbatten’s formula was to divide India but
retain maximum unity.
Why Congress Accepted Dominion Status
The Congress was willing to accept dominion status despite
its being against the Lahore Congress (1929) spirit because

Independence with Partition

 495

(i) it would ensure a peaceful and quick transfer of
power;
(ii) it was more important for the Congress to assume
authority to check the explosive situation; and
(iii) it would allow for some much needed continuity in
the bureaucracy and the army.
For Britain, the dominion status offered a chance to
keep India in the Commonwealth, even if temporarily,
considering the economic strength, defence potential and
greater value of trade and investment in India.
Rationale for an Early Date (August 15, 1947)
Britain wanted to secure Congress’ agreement to the dominion
status. At the same time, the British could escape the
responsibility for the communal situation.
The plan was put into effect without the slightest delay.
The legislative assemblies of Bengal and Punjab decided in
favour of partition of these two provinces. Thus, East Bengal
and West Punjab joined Pakistan; West Bengal and East
Punjab remained with the Indian Union. The referendum in
Sylhet resulted in the incorporation of that district in East
Bengal. Two boundary commissions, one in respect of each
province, were constituted to demarcate the boundaries of
the new provinces. The referendum in NWFP decided in
favour of Pakistan, the Provincial Congress refraining from
the referendum. Baluchistan and Sindh threw in their lot with
Pakistan.

Indian Independence Act

On July 5, 1947 the British Parliament passed the Indian
Independence Act which was based on the Mountbatten Plan,
and the Act got royal assent on July 18, 1947. The Act was
implemented on August 15, 1947.
The Act provided for the creation of two independent
dominions of India and Pakistan with effect from August 15,
1947. Each dominion was to have a governor-general to be
responsible for the effective operation of the Act. The
constituent assembly of the each new dominion was to
exercise the powers of the legislature of that dominion, and
the existing Central Legislative Assembly and the Council
of States were to be automatically dissolved. For the

496  
Plan Balkan
Between March and May of 1947, Mountbatten decided that the
Cabinet Mission Plan had become untenable and formulated an
alternative plan. This plan envisaged the transfer of power to
separate provinces (or to a confederation, if formed before the
transfer), with Punjab and Bengal given the option to vote for
partition of their provinces. The various units thus formed along
with the princely states (rendered independent by lapse of
paramountcy) would have the option of joining India or Pakistan
or remaining separate. The plan was quickly abandoned after
Nehru reacted violently to it.

transitional period, i.e., till a new constitution was adopted
by each dominion, the governments of the two dominions
were to be carried on in accordance with the Government
of India Act, 1935.
As per the provisions of the Indian Independence Act,
1947, Pakistan became independent on August 14 while India
got its freedom on August 15, 1947. M.A. Jinnah became
the first Governor-General of Pakistan. India, however,
decided to request Lord Mountbatten to continue as the
Governor-General of India.

Problems of Early Withdrawal

The breakneck speed of events under Mountbatten caused
anomalies in arranging the details of partition and totally
failed to prevent the Punjab massacre, because
● there were no transitional institutional structures
within which partition problems could be tackled;
● Mountbatten had hoped to be the common GovernorGeneral of India and Pakistan, thus providing the necessary
link, but Jinnah wanted the position for himself in Pakistan;
● there was a delay in announcing the Boundary
Commission Award (under Radcliffe); though the award was
ready by August 12, 1947 Mountbatten decided to make it
public after August 15 so that the British could escape all
responsibility of disturbances.

Integration of States
During 1946-47 there was a new upsurge of the State
People’s Movement demanding political rights and elective

Independence with Partition

representation in the Constituent Assembly. Nehru presided
over the All India State People’s Conference sessions in
Udaipur (1945) and Gwalior (April 1947). He declared that
the states refusing to join the Constituent Assembly would
be treated as hostile. In July 1947, Vallabhbhai Patel took
charge of the new States Department. Under Patel, the
incorporation of Indian states took place in two phases with
a skilful combination of baits and threats of mass pressure
in both.
Phase I By August 15, 1947, all states except Kashmir,
Hyderabad and Junagarh had signed an instrument of accession
with the Indian government, acknowledging central authority
over defence, external affairs and communication. The princes
agreed to this fairly easily because (i) they were ‘surrendering’
only what they never had (these three functions had been a
part of the British paramountcy) and (ii) there was no change
in the internal political structure.
Phase II The second phase involved a much more
difficult process of ‘integration’ of states with neighbouring
provinces or into new units like the Kathiawar Union, Vindhya
and Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh alongwith
internal constitutional changes in states which for some years
retained their old boundaries (Hyderabad, Mysore, TravancoreCochin). This phase was accomplished within a year. The
principal bait offered was a generous privy purse while some
princes were made governors and rajpramukhs in free India.
This rapid political unification of the country after
independence was Patel’s greatest achievement.

Inevitability of Partition
Why Congress Accepted Partition

● The Congress was only accepting the inevitable due
to the long-term failure to draw the Muslim masses into the
national movement. The partition reflects the success-failure
dichotomy of the Congress-led anti-imperialist movement.
The Congress had a two fold task—(i) structuring diverse
classes, communities, groups and regions into a nation, and
(ii) securing independence for this nation. While the Congress

498  

succeeded in building up sufficient national consciousness
to exert pressure on the British to quit India, it failed to
complete the task of welding the nation, especially in
integrating the Muslims into the nation.
● Only an immediate transfer of power could forestall
the spread of ‘direct action’ and communal violence. The
virtual collapse of the Interim Government also made the
notion of Pakistan appear unavoidable.
Views
The British were neither the foes of the Hindus nor friends of
the Muslims. They set up Pakistan not as a gesture of friendship
towards the Muslims, but under the compulsions of their
international policies.
Wali Khan
It was not so much that Britain pursued a policy of divide and
rule as that the process of devolving power by stages in a
politically and socially desperate country was inherently divisive.
R.J. Moore
The truth is that we were tired men, and we were getting on
in years too. Few of us could stand the prospect of going to
prison again—and if we had stood out for a united India as we
wished it, prison obviously awaited us. We saw the fires burning
in the Punjab and heard every day of the killings. The plan for
partition offered a way out and we took it.
Jawaharlal Nehru
I felt that if we did not accept partition, India would be split
into many bits and would be completely ruined. My experience
of office for one year convinced me that the way we have been
proceeding would lead us to disaster. We would not have had
one Pakistan but several. We would have had Pakistan cells
in every office.
Sardar Patel
Congress, as well as the Muslim League, had accepted partition...The real position was, however, completely different...The
acceptance was only in a resolution of the AICC of the Congress
and on the register of the Muslim League. The people of India
had not accepted partition with free and open minds. Some had
accepted it out of sheer anger and resentment and others out
of a sense of despair.
Maulana Azad

Independence with Partition

 499

● The partition plan ruled out independence for the
princely states which could have been a greater danger to
Indian unity as it would have meant Balkanisation of the
country.
● Acceptance of partition was only a final act of the
process of step-by-step concessions to the League’s
championing of a separate Muslim state.
— During Cripps Mission (1942), autonomy of Muslim
majority provinces was accepted.
— During Gandhi-Jinnah talks (1944), Gandhi accepted
the right of self-determination of Muslim-majority provinces.
— After the Cabinet Mission Plan (1946) Congress
conceded the possibility of Muslim majority provinces
setting up a separate constituent assembly. Later, the Congress
accepted, without demur, that grouping was compulsory
(December 1946).
— Official reference to Pakistan came in March 1947,
when CWC resolution stated that Punjab (and by implication,
Bengal) must be partitioned if the country was divided.
— With the 3rd June Plan, Congress accepted partition.
● While loudly asserting the sovereignty of the Constituent Assembly, the Congress quietly accepted compulsory
grouping and accepted the partition most of all because it
could not stop the communal riots.
There was nevertheless much wishful thinking and lack
of appreciation of the dynamics of communal feeling by the
Congress, especially in Nehru who stated at various times—
“Once the British left, Hindu-Muslim differences would
be patched up and a free, united India would be built up.”
“Partition is only temporary.”
“Partition would be peaceful—once Pakistan was
conceded, what was there to fight for?”
The communalism of the 1920s and the 1930s was
different from that of the 1940s. Now it was an all-out effort

for an assertive ‘Muslim nation’. Congress leadership
underestimated the potential of this type of communalism.

Gandhi’s Helplessness

Gandhi felt helpless because there had been a communalisation
of the people. He had no option but to accept partition
because the people wanted it. How could there be a movement
to fight communalism involving a communalised people? He
asked the Congressmen, however, not to accept it in their
hearts.

Constitutional,
Administrative and
Judicial Developments
The establishment of the East India Company in 1600 and
its transformation into a ruling body from a trading one in
1765 had little immediate impact on Indian polity and
governance. But the period between 1773 and 1858 under
the Company rule, and then under the British Crown till 1947,
501

502  

witnessed a plethora of constitutional and administrative
changes. The nature and objective of these changes were to
serve the British imperial ideology but unintentionally they
introduced elements of the modern State into India’s political
and administrative system.

Constitutional Development
between 1773 and 1858
After the Battle of Buxar (1764), the East India Company
got the Diwani (right to collect revenue) of Bengal, Bihar
and Orissa. An annual subsidy was to be paid to the Mughal
Emperor, Shah Alam II, and an annual pension to the Nawab
of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daula. The Company appointed two
Indians as the deputy diwans—Mohammad Reza Khan for
Bengal and Raja Shitab Rai for Bihar.
1767 The first intervention in Indian affairs by the
British government came in 1767. It demanded 10 per cent
share in the plunder amounting to 4 million pounds annually.
1765-72 The dual system of government where the
Company had the authority but no responsibility and its Indian
representatives had all the responsibility but no authority
continued for seven years. This period was characterised by—
● rampant corruption among servants of the Company
who made full use of private trading to enrich
themselves;
● excessive revenue collection and oppression of
peasantry;
● the Company’s bankruptcy, while the servants were
flourishing.
By now the British government decided to regulate the
Company to bring some order into its business. From now,
there would be a gradual increase in controlling laws.

The Regulating Act of 1773

● The 1773 Regulating Act brought about the British
government’s involvement in Indian affairs in the effort to
control and regulate the functioning of the East India
Company. It recognised that the Company’s role in India
extended beyond mere trade to administrative and political

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  503

fields, and introduced the element of centralised
administration.
● The directors of the Company were required to
submit all correspondence regarding revenue affairs and civil
and military administration to the government. (Thus for the
first time, the British cabinet was given the right to exercise
control over Indian affairs.)
● In Bengal, the administration was to be carried out
by governor-general and a council consisting of 4 members,
representing civil and military government. They were required
to function according to the majority rule. Warren Hastings
and four others were named in the Act, later ones were to
be appointed by the Company.
● A Supreme Court of judicature was to be established
in Bengal with original and appellate jurisdictions where all
subjects could seek redressal. In practice, however, the
Supreme Court had a debatable jurisdiction vis-a-vis the
council which created various problems.
● The governor-general could exercise some powers
over Bombay and Madras—again, a vague provision which
created many problems.
The whole scheme was based on checks and balances.
Amendments (1781) ● The jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court was defined—within Calcutta, it was to administer the
personal law of the defendant.
● The servants of the government were immune if they
did anything while discharging their duties.
● Social and religious usages of the subjects were to
be honoured.

Pitt’s India Act of 1784

● The Pitt’s India Act gave the British government a
large measure of control over the Company’s affairs. In fact,
the Company became a subordinate department of the State.
The Company’s territories in India were termed ‘British
possessions’.
● The government’s control over the Company’s affairs
was greatly extended. A Board of Control consisting of the
chancellor of exchequer, a secretary of state and four
members of the Privy Council (to be appointed by the Crown)
were to exercise control over the Company’s civil, military

504  

and revenue affairs. All dispatches were to be approved by
the board. Thus a dual system of control was set up.
● In India, the governor-general was to have a council
of three (including the commander-in-chief), and the
presidencies of Bombay and Madras were made subordinate
to the governor-general.
● A general prohibition was placed on aggressive wars
and treaties (breached often).

The Act of 1786

● Cornwallis wanted to have the powers of both the
governor-general and the commander-in-chief. The new Act
conceded this demand and also gave him the power.
● Cornwallis was allowed to override the council’s
decision if he owned the responsibility for the decision.
Later, this provision was extended to all the governorsgeneral.

The Charter Act of 1793

● The Act renewed the Company’s commercial privileges
for next 20 years.
● The Company, after paying the necessary expenses,
interest, dividends, salaries, etc., from the Indian revenues,
was to pay 5 lakh pounds annually to the British government.
● The royal approval was mandated for the appointment
of the governor-general, the governors, and the commanderin-chief.
● Senior officials of the Company were debarred from
leaving India without permission—doing so was treated as
resignation.
● The Company was empowered to give licences to
individuals as well as the Company’s employees to trade in
India. The licences, known as ‘privilege’ or ‘country trade’,
paved the way for shipments of opium to China.
● The revenue administration was separated from the
judiciary functions and this led to disappearing of the Maal
Adalats.
● The Home Government members were to be paid out
of Indian revenues which continued up to 1919.

The Charter Act of 1813

In England, the business interests were pressing for an end
to the Company’s monopoly over trade in India because of

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  505

a spirit of laissez-faire and the continental system by
Napoleon by which the European ports were closed for
Britain. The 1813 Act sought to redress these grievances—
● The Company’s monopoly over trade in India ended,
but the Company retained the trade with China and the trade
in tea.
● The Company’s shareholders were given a 10.5 per
cent dividend on the revenue of India.
● The Company was to retain the possession of
territories and the revenue for 20 years more, without
prejudice to the sovereignty of the Crown. (Thus, the
constitutional position of the British territories in India was
defined explicitly for the first time.)
● Powers of the Board of Control were further
enlarged.
● A sum of one lakh rupees was to be set aside for
the revival, promotion and encouragement of literature,
learning and science among the natives of India, every year.
(This was an important statement from the point of State’s
responsibility for education.)
● The regulations made by the Councils of Madras,
Bombay and Calcutta were now required to be laid before
the British Parliament. The constitutional position of the
British territories in India was thus explicitly defined for the
first time.
● Separate accounts were to be kept regarding
commercial transactions and territorial revenues. The power
of superintendence and direction of the Board of Control was
not only defined but also enlarged considerably.
● Christian missionaries were also permitted to come
to India and preach their religion.

The Charter Act of 1833

● The lease of 20 years to the Company was further
extended. Territories of India were to be governed in the
name of the Crown.
● The Company’s monopoly over trade with China and
in tea also ended.
● All restrictions on European immigration and the
acquisition of property in India were lifted. Thus, the way
was paved for the wholesale European colonisation of India.

506  
● In India, a financial, legislative and administrative
centralisation of the government was envisaged:
— The governor-general was given the power to
superintend, control and direct all civil and military affairs
of the Company.
— Bengal, Madras, Bombay and all other territories
were placed under complete control of the governor-general.
— All revenues were to be raised under the authority
of the governor-general who would have complete control
over the expenditure too.
— The Governments of Madras and Bombay were
drastically deprived of their legislative powers and left with
a right of proposing to the governor-general the projects of
law which they thought to be expedient.
● A law member was added to the governor-general’s
council for professional advice on law-making.
● Indian laws were to be codified and consolidated.
● No Indian citizen was to be denied employment under
the Company on the basis of religion, colour, birth, descent,
etc. (Although the reality was different, this declaration
formed the sheet-anchor of political agitation in India.)
● The administration was urged to take steps to
ameliorate the conditions of slaves and to ultimately abolish
slavery. (Slavery was abolished in 1843.)

The Charter Act of 1853

● The Company was to continue possession of territories
unless the Parliament provided otherwise.
● The strength of the Court of Directors was reduced
to 18.
● The Company’s patronage over the services was
dissolved—the services were now thrown open to a competitive
examination.
● The law member became the full member of the
governor-general’s executive council.
● The separation of the executive and legislative
functions of the Government of British India progressed with
the inclusion of six additional members for legislative
purposes.
● Local representation was introduced in the Indian

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  507

legislature. The legislative wing came to be known as the
Indian Legislative Council. However, a law to be promulgated
needed the assent of the governor-general, and the governorgeneral could veto any Bill of the legislative council.

The Act for Better Government of India,
1858

The 1857 revolt had exposed the Company’s limitations in
administering under a complex situation. Till then, there had
not been much accountability. The 1858 Act sought to rectify
this anomaly—
● India was to be governed by and in the name of the
Crown through a secretary of state and a council of 15. The
initiative and the final decision was to be with the secretary
of state and the council was to be just advisory in nature.
(Thus, the dual system introduced by the Pitt’s India Act came
to an end.)
● Governor-general became the viceroy (his prestige,
if not authority, increased).
The assumption of power by the Crown was one of
formality rather than substance. It gave a decent burial to an
already dead horse—the Company’s administration.

Developments after 1858 till
Independence
Indian Councils Act, 1861

● The 1861 Act marked an advance in that the principle
of representatives of non-officials in legislative bodies
became accepted; laws were to be made after due deliberation,
and as pieces of legislation they could be changed only by
the same deliberative process. Law-making was thus no
longer seen as the exclusive business of the executive.
● The portfolio system introduced by Lord Canning laid
the foundations of cabinet government in India, each branch
of the administration having its official head and spokesman
in the government, who was responsible for its administration.
● The Act by vesting legislative powers in the
Governments of Bombay and Madras and by making provision

508  

for the institution of similar legislative councils in other
provinces laid the foundations of legislative devolution.
However, the legislative councils established by the Act
of 1861 possessed no real powers and had many weaknesses.
The councils could not discuss important matters and no
financial matters at all without previous approval of
government. They had no control over budget. They could
not discuss executive action. Final passing of the bill needed
viceroy’s approval. Even if approved by the viceroy, the
secretary of state could disallow a legislation. Indians
associated as non-officials were members of elite sections
only.

Indian Councils Act, 1892

● In 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded.
The Congress saw reform of the councils as the “root of
all other reforms”. It was in response to the Congress demand
that the legislative councils be expanded that the number of
non-official members was increased both in the central
(Imperial) and provincial legislative councils by the Indian
Councils Act, 1892.
● The Legislative Council of the Governor-General (or
the Indian Legislative Council, as it came to be known) was
enlarged.
● The universities, district boards, municipalities,
zamindars, trade bodies and chambers of commerce were
empowered to recommend members to the provincial councils.
Thus was introduced the principle of representation.
● Though the term ‘election’ was firmly avoided in the
Act, an element of indirect election was accepted in the
selection of some of the non-official members.
● The members of the legislatures were now entitled
to express their views upon financial statements which were
henceforth to be made on the floor of the legislatures.
● They could also put questions within certain limits
to the executive on matters of public interest after giving
six days’ notice.

Indian Councils Act, 1909

● Popularly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, the
Act made the first attempt to bring in a representative and
popular element in the governance of the country.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  509
● The strength of the Imperial Legislative Council was
increased.
● With regard to the central government, an Indian
member was taken for the first time in the Executive Council
of the Governor-General (Satyendra Prasad Sinha was the
first Indian to join the Governor-General’s—or Viceroy’s—
Executive Council, as law member.)
● The members of the Provincial Executive Council
were increased.
● The powers of the legislative councils, both central
and provincial, were increased.
Under this Act the real power remained with the
government and the councils were left with no functions but
criticism.
The introduction of separate electorates for Muslims
created new problems.
Besides separate electorates for the Muslims,
representation in excess of their population strength was
accorded to the Muslims. Also, the income qualification for
Muslim voters was kept lower than that for Hindus.
The system of election was very indirect.
Thus, the representation of the people at large remained
remote and unreal.

Government of India Act, 1919

This Act was based on what are popularly known as the
Montague-Chelmsford Reforms. In August 1917, the British
government for the first time declared that its objective was
to gradually introduce responsible government in India, but
as an integral part of the British Empire.
The Act of 1919, clarified that there would be only
a gradual development of self-governing institutions in India
and that the British Parliament—and not self-determination
of the people of India—would determine the time and manner
of each step along the path of constitutional progress.
● Under the 1919 Act, the Indian Legislative Council
at the Centre was replaced by a bicameral system consisting
of a Council of State (Upper House) and a Legislative
Assembly (Lower House). Each house was to have a majority
of members who were directly elected. So, direct election

510  

was introduced, though the franchise was much restricted
being based on qualifications of property, tax or education.
● The principle of communal representation was
extended with separate electorates for Sikhs, Christians and
Anglo-Indians, besides Muslims.
● The Act introduced dyarchy in the provinces, which
indeed was a substantial step towards transfer of power to
the Indian people.
● The provincial legislature was to consist of one house
only (legislative council).
● The Act separated for the first time the provincial
and central budgets, with provincial legislatures being
authorised to make their budgets.
● A High Commissioner for India was appointed, who
was to hold his office in London for six years and whose
duty was to look after Indian trade in Europe. Some of the
functions hitherto performed by the Secretary of State for
India were transferred to the high commissioner.
● The Secretary of State for India who used to get his
pay from the Indian revenue was now to be paid by the British
Exchequer, thus undoing an injustice in the Charter Act of
1793.
● Though Indian leaders for the first time got some
administrative experience in a constitutional set-up under this
Act, there was no fulfilment of the demand for responsible
government. Though a measure of power devolved on the
provinces with demarcation of subjects between centre and
provinces, the structure continued to be unitary and centralised.
Dyarchy in the provincial sector failed.
The Central Legislature, though more representative
than the previous legislative councils and endowed, for the
first time, with power to vote supplies, had no power to
replace the government and even its powers in the field of
legislation and financial control were limited and subject to
the overriding powers of the governor-general. Besides his
existing power to veto any bill passed by the legislature or
to reserve the same for the signification of the British
monarch’s pleasure, the governor-general was given the
power to secure the enactment of laws which he considered
essential for the safety, tranquility or interests of British
India, or any part of British India.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  511

The Indian legislature under the Act of 1919 was only
a non-sovereign law-making body and was powerless before
the executive in all spheres of governmental activity, as
Subhash Kashyap observes.

Simon Commission

The 1919 Act had provided that a Royal Commission would
be appointed ten years after the Act to report on its working.
In November 1927, two years before schedule, the British
government announced the appointment of such a
commission—the Indian Statutory Commission. The
commission submitted its report in 1930. It recommended
that dyarchy be abolished, responsible government be extended
in the provinces, a federation of British India and the Princely
States be established, and that communal electorates be
continued.
Three Round Table Conferences were called by the
British government to consider the proposals. Subsequently,
a White Paper on Constitutional Reforms was published
by the British government in March 1933 containing provisions
for a federal set-up and provincial autonomy. A joint committee
of the Houses of the British Parliament was set up under
Lord Linlithgow to further consider the scheme. Its report
submitted in 1934 said that a federation would be set up if
at least 50 per cent of the princely states were ready to join
it. The bill prepared on the basis of this report was passed
by the British Parliament to become the Government of India
Act of 1935.

Government of India Act, 1935

● The Act, with 451 clauses and 15 schedules,
contemplated the establishment of an All-India Federation in
which Governors’ Provinces and the Chief Commissioners’
Provinces and those Indian states which might accede to be
united were to be included. (The ruler of each Princely State
willing to join was to sign an ‘instrument of accession’
mentioning the extent to which authority was to be surrendered
to the federal government.)
● Dyarchy, rejected by the Simon Commission, was
provided for in the Federal Executive.
● The Federal Legislature was to have two chambers
(bicameral)—the Council of States and the Federal Legislative

512  

Assembly. The Council of States (the Upper House) was to
be a permanent body.
● There was a provision for joint sitting in cases of
deadlock between the houses. There were to be three subjectlists—the Federal Legislative List, the Provincial Legislative
List and the Concurrent Legislative List. Residuary
legislative powers were subject to the discretion of the
governor-general. Even if a bill was passed by the federal
legislature, the governor-general could veto it, while even
Acts assented to by the governor-general could be disallowed
by the King-in-Council.
● Dyarchy in the provinces was abolished and provinces
were given autonomy, i.e., the distinction between Reserved
and Transferred Subjects was abolished and full responsible
government was established, subject to certain safeguards.
● Provinces derived their power and authority directly
from the British Crown. They were given independent financial
powers and resources. Provincial governments could borrow
money on their own security.
● Provincial legislatures were further expanded.
Bicameral legislatures were provided in the six provinces of
Madras, Bombay, Bengal, United Provinces, Bihar and Assam,
with other five provinces retaining unicameral legislatures.
● The principles of ‘communal electorates’ and
‘weightage’ were further extended to depressed classes,
women and labour.
● Franchise was extended, with about 10 per cent of
the total population getting the right to vote.
● The Act also provided for a Federal Court (which was
established in 1937), with original and appellate powers, to
interpret the 1935 Act and settle inter-state disputes, but the
Privy Council in London was to dominate this court.
● The India Council of the Secretary of State was
abolished.
● The All-India Federation as visualised in the Act never
came into being because of the opposition from different
parties of India. The British government decided to introduce
the provincial autonomy on April 1, 1937, but the Central
government continued to be governed in accordance with the
1919 Act, with minor amendments. The operative part of the
Act of 1935 remained in force till August 15, 1947.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  513

The 1935 Act was an endeavour to give India a written
constitution, even though Indians were not involved in its
creation, and it was a step towards complete responsible
government in India. However, the Act provided a rigid
constitution with no possibility of internal growth. Right of
amendment was reserved for the British Parliament. Extension
of the system of communal electorates and representation
of various interests promoted separatist tendencies—
culminating in partition of India. The 1935 Act was condemned
by nearly all sections and unanimously rejected by the
Congress. The Congress demanded, instead, convening of a
Constituent Assembly elected on basis of adult franchise to
frame a constitution for independent India.
Various other developments took place after the 1935
Act. There was the August Offer of 1940, the Cripps
Proposals of 1942, the C.R. Formula of 1944 trying to seek
the cooperation of the Muslim League, Wavell Plan of 1945
and the Cabinet Mission. Then came the Mountbatten Plan
in 1947 and finally the Indian Independence Act, 1947.
[These developments have been extensively discussed
in the earlier chapters. The making of the Constitution of
independent India is discussed in a later chapter.]

Evolution of Civil Services in
India
The civil service system introduced in India by the East India
Company for the benefit of its commercial affairs got
transformed into a well structured machinery to look after
the administrative affairs of the acquired territories in India.
In fact, in the beginning, the term ‘civil service’ was used
to distinguish the servants of the Company engaged in
commercial affairs from those people employed in the
military and naval services. Gradually, the civil servants were
bestowed with other responsibilities and authority.

Cornwallis’ Role

Cornwallis (governor-general, 1786-93) was the first to bring
into existence and organise the civil services. He tried to
check corruption through—

514  

raising the civil servants’ salary,
strict enforcement of rules against private trade,
● debarring civil servants from taking presents, bribes
etc.,
● enforcing promotions through seniority.
●
●

Wellesley’s Role

In 1800, Wellesley (governor-general, 1798-1805) set up the
Fort William College for training of new recruits. In 1806
Wellesley’s college was disapproved by the Court of Directors
and instead the East India College was set up at Haileybury
in England to impart two years’ training to the recruits.

Charter Act of 1853

The 1853 Charter Act ended the Company’s patronage,
enjoining recruitment to be through an open competition
henceforth.
The Indians, however, were barred from high posts from
the very beginning. Cornwallis thought, “Every native of
Hindustan is corrupt.” The Charter Act of 1793 had reserved
all posts worth 500 pounds per annum for the covenanted
servants of the Company. The reasons for exclusion of
Indians were—
● the belief that only the English could establish
administrative services serving British interests;
● the belief that the Indians were incapable, untrustworthy and insensitive to the British interests;
● the fact there was high competition among the
Europeans themselves for lucrative posts, so why
offer them to the Indians.
Although the Charter Act of 1833 theoretically threw
open the services to the Indians, the relevant provisions were
never really implemented. After 1857, when the Indians
claimed a share in higher services, the Proclamation of 1858
declared the British intention of including the Indians, freely
and impartially, in offices under the civil service.

Indian Civil Service Act, 1861

This Act reserved certain offices for convenanted civil
servants but the examination was held in England in English
language, based on classical learning of Greek and Latin. The

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  515

maximum permissible age was gradually reduced from 23 (in
1859) to 22 (in 1860) to 21 (in 1866) and to 19 (1878).
In 1863, Satyendra Nath Tagore became the first Indian
to qualify for the Indian Civil Service.

Statutory Civil Service

In 1878-79, Lytton introduced the Statutory Civil
Service consisting of one-sixth of covenanted posts to be
filled by Indians of high families through nominations by
local governments subject to approval by the secretary of
State and the viceroy. But the system failed and was
abolished.

Congress Demand and Aitchison
Committee

The Indian National Congress raised the demand,
after it was set up in 1885, for
● lowering of age limit for recruitment, and
● holding the examination simultaneously in India and
Britain.
The Aitchison Committee on Public Services (1886),
set up by Dufferin, recommended—
● dropping
of the terms ‘covenanted’ and
‘uncovenanted’;
● classification of the civil service into Imperial Indian
Civil Service (examination in England), Provincial
Civil Service (examination in India) and Subordinate
Civil Service (examination in India); and,
● raising the age limit to 23.
In 1893, the House of Commons in England passed a
resolution supporting holding of simultaneous examination
in India and England; but the resolution was never implemented.
Kimberley, the secretary of state, said, “It is indispensable
that an adequate number of members of civil service shall
always be Europeans.”

Montford Reforms (1919)

The Montford reforms—
● stated a realistic policy—“If a responsible government
is to be established in India, the more Indians we
can employ in public service, the better.”

516  

recommended holding of simultaneous examination
in India and England.
● recommended that one-third of recruitments be made
in India itself—to be raised annually by 1.5 per cent.
●

Lee Commission (1924)

The Lee Commission recommended that—
● the secretary of state should continue to recruit the
ICS, the Irrigation branch of the Service of Engineers,
the Indian Forest Service, etc.;
● the recruitments for the transferred fields like
education and civil medical service be made by
provincial governments;
● direct recruitment to ICS on basis of 50:50 parity
between the Europeans and the Indians be reached
in 15 years;
● a Public Service Commission be immediately
established (as laid down in the Government of India
Act, 1919).
Government of India Act, 1935
The 1935 Act recommended the establishment of a Federal
Public Service Commission and Provincial Public Service
Commission under their spheres.
But the positions of control and authority remained in
British hands and the process of Indianisation of the civil
service did not put effective political power in Indian hands
since the Indian bureaucrats acted as the agents of colonial
rule.

Evaluation of Civil Services under
British Rule

Just as Indians were systematically excluded from law and
policy-making bodies, they were mostly kept out of the
institutions responsible for policy implementation. European
supremacy was assured in the civil service as in other spheres
of governance. This was done in mainly two ways.
Firstly, although Indians had begun to enter the coveted
ranks of the Indian Civil Services (ICS) ever since 1863,
entering the civil services was still extremely difficult for
the Indians. The entrance examination for the ICS was held

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  517

in London in English medium only, and the subjects included
classical Greek and Latin learning. Moreover, the maximum
age for appearing at the examination was reduced from
twenty-three in 1859 to nineteen in 1878 under Lytton.
Secondly, all key positions of power and authority and
those which were well-paid were occupied by the Europeans.
Though a slow process of Indianisation occurred after
1918 under nationalist pressure, important and senior positions
continued to be occupied by Europeans. But gradually, the
Indians came to realise that Indianisation of civil service had
not, in any way, transferred effective power into Indian hands.
The Indian members of the civil service continued to serve
the imperialist interests of their British masters.

Evolution of Police System in
Modern India
In pre-colonial India, the governments, under the Mughals and
other native states, were autocratic in nature, and lacked a
separate or formal police system. However, there have been
watch guards since time immemorial protecting villages at
night. Later, under the Mughal rule there were the faujdars
who helped in maintaining law and order, and amils who were
basically revenue collectors but had to contend with rebels,
if any. The kotwal was responsible for maintenance of law
and order in the cities. Even during the dual rule in Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa between 1765 and 1772 the zamindars were
expected to maintain the staff including thanedars for law
and order duties and for maintaining peace, as well as dealing
with crime and criminals. But very often, the zamidars
neglected their duties. They are even said to have colluded
with dacoits and shared their loot. In 1770, the institution
of the faujdar and amils were abolished. However, in 1774,
Warren Hastings restored the institution of faujdars and
asked the zamindars to assist them in suppression of dacoits,
violence and disorder. In 1775, faujdar thanas were
established in the major towns of large districts and were
assisted by several smaller police stations.
An account of steady developments in the police
system under the British have been given below.

518  

1791 Cornwallis organised a regular police force to
maintain law and order by going back to and modernising the
old Indian system of thanas (circles) in a district under a
daroga (an Indian) and a superintendent of police (SP) at
the head of a district. He relieved the zamindars of their
police duties.
1808 Mayo appointed an SP for each division helped
by a number of spies (goyendas) but these spies committed
depredations on local people.
1814 By an order of the Court of Directors, the
appointment of darogas and their subordinates was abolished
in all possessions of the Company except in Bengal.
Bentinck (governor-general, 1828-35) abolished the
office of the SP. The collector/magistrate was now to head
the police force in his jurisdiction and the commissioner in
each division was to act as the SP. This arrangement resulted
in a badly organised police force, putting a heavy burden on
the collector/magistrate. Presidency towns were the first to
have the duties of collector/magistrate separated.
The recommendations of the Police Commission
(1860) led to the Indian Police Act, 1861. The commission
recommended—
● a system of civil constabulary—maintaining the village
set-up in the present form (a village watchman
maintained by the village) but in direct relationship
with the rest of the constabulary.
● inspector-general as the head in a province, deputy
inspector-general as the head in a range, and SP as
the head in a district.
The police gradually succeeded in curbing criminal
acts, such as dacoity, thugee, etc. But, while dealing with
the public, the attitude of the police was unsympathetic. The
police was also used to suppress the national movement.
The British did not create an All-India Police. The
Police Act, 1861 presented the guidelines for a police setup in the provinces. The ranks were uniformly introduced all
over the country.
1902 The Police Commission recommended the
establishment of CID (Criminal Investigation Department) in
the provinces and a Central Intelligence Bureau at the Centre.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  519

Military Under the British
The military was the backbone of the Company’s rule in India.
Prior to the revolt of 1857, there were two separate sets
of military forces under the British control, which operated
in India. The first set of units, known as the Queen’s army,
were the serving troops on duty in India. The other was the
Company’s troops—a mixture of European regiments of
Britons and Native regiments recruited locally from India but
with British officers. The Queen’s army was part of Crown’s
military force.
After 1857, there was a systematic reorganisation of
the Army since, as Dufferin warned in December 1888, “the
British should always remember the lessons which were
learnt with such terrible experience 30 years ago.”
To prevent the recurrence of another revolt was the
main reason behind this reorganisation. Also, the Indian Army
was to be used to defend the Indian territory of the empire
from other imperialist powers in the region—Russia,
Germany, France, etc. The Indian branch of the army was to
be used for expansion in Asia and Africa, while the British
section was to be used as an army of occupation—the
ultimate guarantee of British hold over India.
To begin with, domination of the European branch over
the Indian branches was ensured. The commissions of 1859
and 1879 insisted on the principle of a one-third white army
(as against 14% before 1857). Finally, the proportion of
Europeans to Indians was carefully fixed at one to two in
the Bengal Army and two to five in the Madras and Bombay
Armies. Strict European monopoly over key geographical
locations and departments, such as artillery, tanks and armed
corps, was maintained. Even the rifles given to Indians were
of an inferior quality till 1900, and Indians were not allowed
in these high-tech departments till the Second World War.
No Indians were allowed in the officer rank, and the highest
rank an Indian could reach till 1914 was that of a subedar
(only from 1918 onwards were Indians allowed in the
commissioned ranks). As late as 1926, the Indian Sandhurst
Committee was visualising a 50% Indianised officer cadre
for 1952!

520  

The Indian branch was reorganised on basis of the
policy of balance and counterpoise or divide and rule. The
1879 Army Commission had emphasised—“Next to the grand
counterpoise of a sufficient European force comes the
counterpoise of natives against natives.” An ideology of
‘martial races’ and ‘non-martial races’, which assumed that
good soldiers could come only from some specific
communities, developed particularly from the late 1880s,
under Lord Roberts, the commander-in-chief from 1887 to
1892. It was used to justify a discriminatory recruitment
policy directed towards Sikhs, Gurkhas and Pathans who had
assisted in the suppression of the revolt and were relatively
marginal social groups—therefore less likely to be affected
by nationalism. The soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, Central India
and South India who had participated in the revolt were
declared to be non-martial. Moreover, caste and communal
companies were introduced in all the regiments and Indian
regiments were made a mixture of various socio-ethnic
groups so as to balance each other. Communal, caste, tribal
and regional consciousness was encouraged to check the
growth of nationalist feelings among soldiers. Charles Wood,
the Secretary of State for India, said, “I wish to have a
different and rival spirit in different regiments, so that Sikh
might fire into Hindu, Gorkha into either, without any scruple
in case of need.” Finally, conscious efforts were made to
isolate the soldiers from life and thoughts of rest of the
population through measures such as preventing newspapers,
journals and nationalist publications from reaching them.
On the whole, the British Indian Army remained a
costly military machine.

Development of Judiciary in
British India
In the India of pre-colonial times—in the Mughal era or even
prior to that (including the ancient period)—the judicial
system, as a whole, neither adopted proper procedures nor
had proper organisation of the law courts—in a regular
gradation from the highest to the lowest—nor had any proper

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  521

distribution of courts in proportion to the area to be served
by them. The bulk of the litigation among the Hindus was
decided by caste elders or village panchayats or zamindars.
For Muslims, the unit of judicial administration was the
qazi—an office held by religious persons—located in
provincial capitals, towns and qasbas (large villages). The
rajas and badshahs were considered as the fountainhead of
justice, and the process of dispensing justice could be
arbitrary.
The beginning of a common law system, based on
recorded judicial precedents, can be traced to the establishment
of ‘Mayor’s Courts’ in Madras, Bombay and Calcutta in 1726
by the East India Company. With the Company’s
transformation from a trading company into a ruling power,
new elements of judicial system replaced the existing Mughal
legal system. A brief survey of those changes has been
discussed below.

Reforms under Warren Hastings
(1772-1785)

● District Diwani Adalats were established in districts
to try civil disputes. These adalats were placed under the
collector and had Hindu law applicable for Hindus and the
Muslim law for Muslims. The appeal from District Diwani
Adalats lay to the Sadar Diwani Adalat which functioned under
a president and two members of the Supreme Council.
● District Fauzdari Adalats were set up to try criminal
disputes and were placed under an Indian officer assisted by
qazis and muftis. These adalats also were under the general
supervision of the collector. Muslim law was administered
in Fauzdari Adalats. The approval for capital punishment and
for acquisition of property lay to the Sadar Nizamat Adalat
at Murshidabad which was headed by a deputy nizam (an
Indian Muslim) assisted by chief qazi and chief mufti.
● Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a Supreme Court
was established at Calcutta which was competent to try all
British subjects within Calcutta and the subordinate factories,
including Indians and Europeans. It had original and appellate
jurisdictions. Often, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
clashed with that of other courts.

522  

Reforms under Cornwallis (1786-1793)—
Separation of Powers

● The District Fauzdari Courts were abolished and,
instead, circuit courts were established at Calcutta, Dacca,
Murshidabad and Patna. These circuit courts had European
judges and were to act as courts of appeal for both civil and
criminal cases.
● The Sadar Nizamat Adalat was shifted to Calcutta and
was put under the governor-general and members of the
Supreme Council assisted by the chief qazi and the chief
mufti.
● The District Diwani Adalat was now designated as the
District, City or the Zila Court and placed under a district
judge. The collector was now responsible only for the
revenue administration with no magisterial functions.
● A gradation of civil courts was established (for both
Hindu and Muslim laws)—
(i) Munsiff’s Court under Indian officers,
(ii) Registrar’s Court under a European judge,
(iii) District Court under the district judge,
(iv) Four Circuit Courts as provincial courts of appeal,
(v) Sadar Diwani Adalat at Calcutta, and
(vi) King-in-Council for appeals of 5000 pounds and
above.
● The Cornwallis Code was laid out—
— There was a separation of revenue and justice
administration.
— European subjects were also brought under
jurisdiction.
— Government officials were answerable to the civil
courts for actions done in their official capacity.
— The principle of sovereignty of law was established.

Reforms under William Bentinck
(1828-1833)

● The four Circuit Courts were abolished and their
functions transferred to collectors under the supervision of
the commissioner of revenue and circuit.
● Sadar Diwani Adalat and a Sadar Nizamat Adalat were
set up at Allahabad for the convenience of the people of
Upper Provinces.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  523
● Till now, Persian was the official language in courts.
Now, the suitor had the option to use Persian or a vernacular
language, while in the Supreme Court, English language
replaced Persian.
1833 : A Law Commission was set up under Macaulay
for codification of Indian laws. As a result, a Civil Procedure
Code (1859), an Indian Penal Code (1860) and a Criminal
Procedure Code (1861) were prepared.

Later Developments

1860 : It was provided that the Europeans can claim
no special privileges except in criminal cases, and no judge
of an Indian origin could try them.
1865 : The Supreme Court and the Sadar Adalats were
merged into three High Courts at Calcutta, Bombay and
Madras.
1935 : The Government of India Act provided for a
Federal Court (set up in 1937) which could settle disputes
between governments and could hear limited appeals from
the High Courts.

Evaluation
Positive Aspects of Judiciary under the British
● The rule of law was established.
● The codified laws replaced the religious and personal
laws of the rulers.
● Even European subjects were brought under the
jurisdiction, although in criminal cases, they could be tried
by European judges only.
● Government servants were made answerable to the
civil courts.
The Negative Aspects
● The judicial system became more and more
complicated and expensive. The rich could manipulate the
system.
● There was ample scope for false evidence, deceit and
chicanery.
● Dragged out litigation meant delayed justice.
● Courts became overburdened as litigation increased.
● Often, the European judges were not familiar with
the Indian usage and traditions.

Major Changes in
Administrative Structure after
1857
Genesis of Administrative Changes:
New Stage of Colonialism

The British were quick to learn from their experience of
1857—an organised mass action could pose a serious
challenge to the existence of British rule in India. The rulersubject gap was sought to be narrowed so as to reduce, if
not eliminate altogether, the alienation of the masses from
the administration. Also, association of natives in
administration could give the rulers an opportunity to have
a better idea of the customs, traditions and values of the
people they were supposed to rule. This could help them
handle more tactfully an 1857-like situation.
The second half of the nineteenth century saw further
spread and intensification of the industrial revolution. The
emergence of new industrial powers—the USA, Japan and
European countries—and a cut-throat competition for colonies
and sub-colonies for raw materials, markets for manufactured
goods and capital investment were the highlights of this new
phenomenon. The British supremacy in the world in finance
and manufactured goods trade came to an end. At this point,
there were large-scale British capital investments in railways
and loans to the Government of India, and to a smaller extent
in tea plantations, coal-mining, jute mills, shipping, trade and
banking.
All these factors combined to inaugurate a new stage
of colonialism in India. The prime concern of the colonial
authority in India was to consolidate its position here to
secure British economic and commercial interests against
political dangers and to extend its sphere to other parts of
the world, wherever and whenever possible. There was a
renewed upsurge of imperial control and imperialist ideology
which was reflected in the reactionary policies during the
vice-royalties of Lytton, Dufferin, Lansdowne, Elgin and,
above all, Curzon. The changes in the governmental structure

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  525

and policies in India were to shape the destiny of modern
India in many ways.

Administration: Central,
Provincial, Local
Central Government

The Act for Better Government of India, 1858 transferred
the power to govern from the East India Company to the
British Crown. The Company’s limitations in administering
the country in complex situations had been exposed by the
revolt of 1857; besides, there was not much accountability.
Now, the power to govern was to be wielded through a
secretary of state (earlier this power was exercised by
Directors of the Company and the Board of Control). The
secretary of state was to be a member of the British cabinet,
and was to be assisted by a council of 15. He was answerable
to the British Parliament. All initiatives and final decisions
rested with the secretary and the council was only advisory
in nature. (Thus the dual system introduced by Pitt’s India
Act, 1784 came to an end.) Also, the ultimate power over
India remained with Parliament.
The Government in India was to be carried on, as
before, by the governor-general whose prestige, if not
authority, increased with the new title of viceroy given to
him. The viceroy was to be assisted by an executive council
whose members were to act as the heads of various
departments, as well as viceroy’s official advisors.
The concentration of the main authority in the hands
of the secretary of state based in London, on the one hand,
gradually reduced the viceroy to a subordinate status and
further alienated the Indian public opinion from the government
policy-making. On the other hand, it had the effect of
increasing the influence of British industrialists, merchants
and bankers over government policy in India. This made the
Indian administration even more reactionary than it had been
before 1858.
By the Indian Councils Act, 1861, a fifth member,
who was to be a jurist, was added to viceroy’s executive

526  

council. For legislative purposes, the viceroy could add six
to twelve additional members, of whom at least half had to
be non-officials who could be either Indian or English. The
legislative council so constituted possessed no real powers
and was merely advisory in nature. Its weaknesses were as
follows—
● It could not discuss important matters, and no
financial matters at all without previous approval of the
Government.
● It had no control over the budget.
● It could not discuss executive action.
● Final passing of the bill needed the viceroy’s approval.
● Even if approved by the viceroy, the secretary of state
could disallow a legislation.
● Indians associated as non-officials were members of
elite sections only—princes, landlords, diwans, etc.—and
were not representative of the Indian opinion.
● The viceroy could issue ordinances (of 6 months
validity) in case of emergency.
The only important function of the legislative council
was to endorse official measures and give them the appearance
of having been passed by a legislative body. The British
Government in India remained, as before, an alien despotism.

Provincial Government
The Indian Councils Act, 1861 returned the legislative powers
to provinces of Madras and Bombay which had been taken
away in 1833. Later, legislative councils were established in
other provinces. The three presidencies of Bombay, Madras
and Calcutta enjoyed more rights and powers compared to
other provinces. The presidencies were administrated by a
governor and his executive council of three who were
appointed by the Crown, while other provinces were
administered by lieutenant governors and chief commissioners
appointed by the governor-general.
In the following decades, some steps towards financial
decentralisation were taken, but these were more in the nature
of administrative reorganisation aimed at increasing revenues
and reducing expenditure and these did not in any way indicate
progress towards provincial autonomy.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  527

The granting of fixed sums out of central revenues for
administration of certain services like police, jails, education,
medical services and roads to provincial governments signified
the first step in the direction towards bifurcating central and
provincial finances in 1870 by Lord Mayo. Now, the provincial
governments were asked to administer these services as they
liked.
Certain other heads of expenditure like land revenue,
excise, general administration and law and justice were
transferred to provinces in 1877 by Lord Lytton. Besides
this, a provincial government was to receive a fixed share
of the income realised within that province from sources like
stamps, excise and income tax.
In 1882, all sources of revenue were divided into three
groups—general (going entirely to centre), provincial (going
entirely to the provinces) and those to be divided between
the centre and the provinces.
Nevertheless, the central government remained supreme
and retained detailed control over provinces. This was inevitable since both the central and provincial governments were
completely subordinated to the secretary of state and the
British Government.

Local Bodies

It was decided to decentralise administration by promoting
local government through municipalities and district boards
which would administer local services like education, health,
sanitation, water supply, roads and other basic amenities
financed through local taxes. There were many factors which
made it necessary for the British government in India to work
towards establishing local bodies.
(i) Financial difficulties faced by the Government, due
to overcentralisation, made decentralisation imperative.
(ii) It became necessary that modern advances in civic
amenities in Europe be transplanted in India considering
India’s increasing economic contacts with Europe.
(iii) The rising tide of nationalism had improvement in
basic facilities as a point on its agenda.
(iv) A section of British policy-makers saw association
of Indians with the administration in some form or the other,

528  

without undermining the British supremacy in India, as an
instrument to check the increasing politicisation of Indians.
(v) The utilisation of local taxes for local welfare could
be used to counter any public criticism of British reluctance
to draw upon an already overburdened treasury or to tax the
rich upper classes.
The important stages in the evolution of local government
can be identified as follows.
Between 1864 and 1868
Local bodies were first formed in this period but in most
cases consisted of nominated members and were headed by
district magistrates. Thus, these were seen not more than as
instruments of additional tax collection.
Mayo’s Resolution of 1870
Financial decentralisation was a legislative devolution
inaugurated by the Indian Councils Act of 1861. Apart from
the annual grant from imperial Government, the provincial
governments were authorised to resort to local taxation to
balance their budgets. This was done in context of transfer
of certain departments of administration, such as medical
services, education and roads, to the control of provincial
governments. This was the beginning of local finance. Mayo’s
Resolution emphasised, “Local interest, supervision and care
are necessary for success in the management of the funds
devoted to education, sanitation, medical relief and local
public works.”
The various provincial governments such as in Bengal,
Madras, North-Western Province, Punjab, passed municipal
acts to implement the policy outlined.
Ripon’s Resolution of 1882
The Government of Ripon desired the provincial governments
to apply in case of local bodies the same principle of
financial decentralisation which Lord Mayo’s Government
had begun towards them. For his contributions, Lord Ripon
is called father of local self-government in India. The main
points of the resolution were as follows.
● Development of local bodies advocated to improve
the administration and as an instrument of political and
popular education;

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  529
● Policy of administrating local affairs through urban
and rural local bodies charged with definite duties and
entrusted with suitable sources of revenues;
● Non-officials to be in majority in these bodies, who
could be elected if the officials thought that it was possible
to introduce elections;
● Non-officials to act as chairpersons to these bodies;
● Official interference to be reduced to the minimum
and to be exercised to revise and check the acts of local
bodies, but not to dictate policies;
● Official executive sanction required in certain cases,
such as raising of loans, alienation of municipal property,
imposition of new taxes, undertaking works costing more
than a prescribed sum, framing rules and bye-laws, etc.
In pursuance of this resolution many Acts were passed
between 1883 and 1885 which greatly altered the constitution,
powers and functions of municipal bodies in India. But, an
era of effective local self-governing bodies was still a dream
unfulfilled. The existing local bodies had various drawbacks.
● The elected members were in a minority in all district
boards and in many of the municipalities;
● The franchise was very limited;
● District boards continued to be headed by district
officials, though non-officials gradually came to head the
municipalities;
● The Government retained strict control, and it could
suspend or supersede these bodies at will.
The bureaucracy, in fact, did not share the liberal views
of the viceroy and thought that the Indians were unfit for
self-government. The closing decades of the 19th century
were a period of imperialism, and the high priest of that
creed, Lord Curzon, actually took steps to increase official
control over local bodies.
Royal Commission on Decentralisation (1908)
Pointing out the lack of financial resources as the great
stumbling block in the effective functioning of local bodies,
the commission made the following recommendations.
(i) It emphasised that village panchayats should be
entrusted with more powers like judicial jurisdiction in petty

530  

cases, incurring expenditure on minor village works, village
schools, small fuel and fodder reserves, etc. The panchayats
should be given adequate sources of income.
(ii) It emphasised the importance of sub-district boards
to be established in every taluka or tehsil, with separate
spheres of duties and separate sources of revenue for subdistrict boards and the district boards.
(iii) It urged the withdrawal of existing restrictions on
their powers of taxation, and also, the stoppage of regular
grants-in-aid from provincial governments except for
undertaking large projects.
(iv) The municipalities might undertake the responsibility for primary education and, if willing, for middle
vernacular schools, otherwise the Government should relieve
them of any charges in regard to secondary education,
hospitals, relief, police, veterinary works, etc.
The Government of India Resolution of 1915
This resolution contained the official views on the
recommendations of the Decentralisation Commission, but
most of the recommendations remained on paper and the
condition of local bodies continued to be as it was left by
Lord Ripon.
The Resolution of May 1918
This resolution reviewed the entire question of local selfgovernment in the light of the announcement of August 20,
1917, which had declared that the future direction of
constitutional advance was towards grant of responsible
government to the people of India and the first step towards
the progressive realisation of that ideal was to be in the
sphere of local self-government.
The resolution suggested that the local bodies be made
as representative as possible of the people with real and not
nominal authority vested in them.
Under Dyarchy
Local self-government was made a ‘transferred’ subject under
popular ministerial control by Government of India Act,
1919, and each province was allowed to develop local selfinstitutions according to provincial needs and requirements.

Constitutional, Administrative and ...  531

But, since finance was a ‘reserved’ subject under the charge
of an executive councillor, the Indian ministers could not do
much work in the sphere of local self-government for lack
of funds.
The Simon Commission (May 1930) pointed out the
lack of progress of village panchayats except in UP, Bengal
and Madras. The commission suggested the retrograde step
of increasing provincial control over local bodies for the sake
of efficiency. The commission also adversely commented on
reluctance of elected members to impose local taxes and
observed that, generally speaking, the management of finances
of local bodies had deteriorated since the introduction of the
reforms of 1919.
The Government of India Act, 1935 and After
The provincial autonomy ushered in by the Government of
India Act, 1935 gave further impetus to the development of
local self-governing institutions in India. Portfolio finance
being under the control of popular ministries, now the funds
could be made available for development of local bodies.
Further, the demarcation of taxation between provincial and
local finance which prevailed since the reforms of 1919 was
scrapped. New Acts were passed in the provinces giving more
authority to local bodies.
However, financial resources and power of taxation of
local institutions remained more or less at the same level
as in the days of Ripon. Rather, after 1935, certain new
restrictions were placed on powers of local bodies to levy
or enhance terminal taxes on trades, callings and professions
and municipal property. The provincial governments seemed
to have ignored the liberal policy of granting wide powers
of taxation to local institutions as recommended by the
Decentralisation Commission (1908).
[The Constitution of free India directs the state
governments to organise village panchayats as effective
organs of local self-government (Article 40). The Seventythird and Seventy-fourth Amendments are aimed at plugging
the loopholes in the structure of local self-governing
institutions in rural and urban areas.]

Chapter 27

Survey of British
Policies in India
Administrative Policies
Contrary to their pre-1857 intentions of trying to modernise
India on progressive lines, now the administration adopted
blatantly reactionary policies on the pretext that Indians were
not fit for self-governance and needed British presence in
their lives.

Divide and Rule

Determined to avoid a united mass action challenging their
authority, the British rulers in India decided to practice a
naked policy of divide and rule, by putting princes against
states’ people, region against region, province against province,
caste against caste and Hindus against Muslims.
After an immediate spell of repression against Muslims,
following the 1857 revolt, the authorities decided, after
1870, to use the middle and upper educated classes among
Muslims against the rising tide of nationalism, using conflicts
over scarce resources in education, administrative jobs and
later political spoils (which were inherent in the very logic
of colonial underdevelopment) as a tool to create a split
along religious lines among educated Indians.

Hostility Towards Educated Indians

The emerging middle class nationalist leadership was analysing
the exploitative, colonial character of British rule and
demanding Indian participation in administration. At a time

Anil Seal

when the nationalist movement was born (Indian National
Congress was founded in 1885), the British interpreted the
moves as a challenge to their authority and adopted a hostile
attitude to such leadership. In fact, from then onwards, they
opposed all those who stood for modern education.

Attitude Towards the Zamindars

In their pursuit of reactionary policies and hope to expand
their social base, the British looked for alliances with the
most reactionary of social groups—the princes, zamindars,
etc. The British intended to use them as a counterweight
against nationalist-minded intelligentsia. Now, the zamindars
and landlords were hailed as the ‘natural’ and ‘traditional’
leaders of people. Lands of most of the Awadh taluqdars
confiscated prior to 1857 were restored to them. The
interests and privileges of zamindars and landlords were
protected in opposition to those of the peasants; the former
in turn saw the British as guarantors of their very existence
and became their firm supporters.

Attitude Towards Social Reforms

Having decided to side with the reactionary elements of
Indian society, the British withdrew support to social reforms,
which they felt had aroused the wrath of orthodox sections
against them. Also, by encouraging caste and communal
consciousness, the British helped the reactionary forces.

Underdeveloped Social Services

A disproportionately large expenditure on army and civil
administration and the cost of wars left little to be spent on
social services like education, health, sanitation, physical
infrastructure, etc., a legacy which still haunts this country.
And whatever facilities were established catered to the elite
sections and urban areas.

534  

Labour Legislations

As in the early stages of industrial revolution in Europe, the
working conditions in factories and plantations in the
nineteenth-century India were miserable. Working hours were
long—for women and children as well as for men—and wages
were low. In overcrowded, poorly ventilated and poorly
lighted working places, the safety measures were practically
non-existent.
Ironically, the first-ever demand for regulation of the
condition of workers in factories in India came from the
Lancashire textile capitalist lobby. Apprehending the
emergence of a competitive rival in the Indian textile industry
under conditions of cheap and unregulated labour, they
demanded the appointment of a commission for investigation
into factory conditions. The first commission was appointed
in 1875 although the first Factory Act was not passed before
1881.
The Indian Factory Act, 1881 dealt primarily with the
problem of child labour (between 7 and 12 years of age).
Its significant provisions were:
● employment of children under 7 years of age prohibited,
● working hours restricted to 9 hours per day for children,
● children to get four holidays in a month,
● hazardous machinery to be properly fenced off.
The Indian Factory Act, 1891
● increased the minimum age (from 7 to 9 years) and
the maximum (from 12 to 14 years) for children,
● reduced maximum working hours for children to 7
hours a day,
● fixed maximum working hours for women at 11
hours per day with an one-and-a-half hour interval
(working hours for men were left unregulated),
● provided weekly holiday for all.
But these laws did not apply to British-owned tea and
coffee plantations where the labour was exploited ruthlessly
and treated like slaves. The Government helped these planters
by passing laws such as those which made it virtually
impossible for a labourer to refuse to work once a contract
was entered into. A breach of contract was a criminal offence,
with a planter having the right to get the defaulting labourer
arrested.

I am sorry to hear of the increasing friction between the Hindus
and Mohammedans in the north-west and the Punjab. One hardly
knows what to wish, for unity of ideas and action could be very
dangerous politically; divergence of ideas and collision are
administratively troublesome. Of the two, the latter is least risky,
though it throws anxiety and responsibility upon those on the
spot where the friction exists.

The English were an imperial race, we were told, with God-given
right to govern us and keep us in subjection; if we protested,
we were reminded of the tiger qualities of an imperial race.
Jawaharlal Nehru

More labour laws were passed under nationalist pressures
in the twentieth century but the overall working conditions
remained deplorable as ever.

Restrictions on Freedom of the Press

The nationalists had been quick to use new advancements in
press technology to educate public opinion and influence
government policies through criticism and censure and later
to arouse national consciousness.
In 1835, Metcalfe had lifted restrictions imposed on
the Indian press. But Lytton, fearing an increased influence
of the nationalist press on public opinion, imposed restrictions
on Indian language press through the infamous Vernacular
Press Act, 1878. This Act had to be repealed under public
protest in 1882. After that, the press enjoyed relative
freedom for about two decades, but was under repression
again in the wake of swadeshi and anti-partition movement
as restrictions were imposed in 1908 and 1910. (Also refer
to chapter on “Development of Press in India”.)

White Racism

The notion of white superiority was maintained very carefully
by the colonial rulers by systematically excluding the Indians
from higher grades of services—both civil and military—
from railway compartments, parks, hotels, clubs, etc., and by
public display of racial arrogance through beatings, blows and
even murders (reported as accidents). As Elgin once wrote,
“We could only govern by maintaining the fact that we were
the dominant race—though Indians in services should be
encouraged, there is a point at which we must reserve the
control to ourselves, if we are to remain at all.”

536  

British Social and Cultural
Policy in India
Till 1813, the British followed a policy of non-interference
in the social, religious and cultural life of the country. After
1813, measures were taken to transform Indian society and
its cultural environs because of the emergence of new
interests and ideas in Britain of the nineteenth century in the
wake of significant changes in Europe during the 18th and
the 19th centuries. Some of these changes were—
(i) Industrial Revolution which began in the 18th
century and resulted in the growth of industrial capitalism.
The rising industrial interests wanted to make India a big
market for their goods and therefore required partial
modernisation and transformation of Indian society.
(ii) Intellectual Revolution which gave rise to new
attitudes of mind, manners, and morals.
(iii) French Revolution which with its message of
liberty, equality and fraternity, unleashed the forces of
democracy and nationalism.
The new trend was represented by Bacon, Locke,
Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith and Bentham in
thought and by Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley and Charles
Dickens in literature.

Characteristics of New Thought

Some of the characteristics of the new wave of thought
were—
(i) Rationalism which advocated faith in reason and
a scientific attitude.
(ii) Humanism which advocated the love of man—the
belief that every man is an end in himself and should be
respected and prized as such. No man has a right to look
upon another man as a mere agent of his happiness. These
ideals gave rise to liberalism, socialism and individualism.
(iii) Doctrine of Progress according to which nothing
is static and all societies must change with time. Man has
the capacity to remodel nature and society on just and rational
lines.

Schools of Thought

These new currents of thought caused conflicts among
administrators and produced different schools of thought:

Survey of British Policies in India

 537

The Conservatives advocated introduction of as few
changes as possible. Indian civilisation, they felt, was different
from the European one but not necessarily inferior to it.
Many of these thinkers respected Indian philosophy and
culture. If at all, Western ideas and practices were to be
introduced gradually and cautiously. Social stability was a
must, they felt. Early representatives of this school of
thought were Warren Hastings and Edmund Burke and later
ones included Munro, Metcalfe, and Elphinstone. The
Conservatives remained influential throughout and most of
the British officials in India were generally of a conservative
persuasion.
The Paternalistic Imperialists became influential
especially after 1800. They were sharply critical of Indian
society and culture and used to justify economic and political
enslavement of India.
The Radicals went beyond the narrow criticism and
imperialistic outlook of the Conservatives and the Imperialists
and applied advanced humanistic and rational thought to the
Indian situation. They thought that India had the capacity to
improve and that they must help the country do that. They
wanted to make India a part of the modern progressive world
of science and humanism and therefore advocated the
introduction of modern western science, philosophy and
literature. Some of the British officials who came to India
after 1820 were Radicals. They were strongly supported by
Raja Rammohan Roy and other like-minded reformers.
But predominantly, the ruling elements in the British
Indian administration continued to be imperialistic and
exploitative. They thought that the modernisation of India had
to occur within broad limits imposed by the needs of an
easier and more thorough exploitation of its resources. In
this respect, often the Radicals also towed a conservative
line. They desired most of all the safety and perpetuation
of the British rule in India; every other consideration was
secondary.

Indian Renaissance

There were many Indians who instigated social reform and
caused legislations to be brought about so as to control and
eradicate social evils imbedded in so-called tradition.
Rammohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, B.M. Malabari,

538  

to name a few social reformers, worked hard to get legislation
passed by the government to remove social evils. [These
aspects have been discussed in detail in the chapter on
Religious and Social Reform.]

Dilemma Before the Government

The government feared that too much modernisation might
generate forces hostile to their interests; thus it was thought
to be appropriate to opt for partial modernisation—introducing
it in some respects and blocking it in others, in other words,
a ‘colonial modernisation’.

Role of Christian Missionaries

The missionaries regarded Christianity to be a superior
religion and wanted to spread it in India through westernisation
which, they believed, would destroy the faith of the natives
in their own religion and culture. Towards this end, the
Christian missionaries
— supported the Radicals whose scientific approach,
they believed, would undermine the native culture
and beliefs;
— supported the Imperialists since law and order and
the British supremacy were essential for their
propaganda; and
— sought business and the capitalist support holding
out the hope to them that the Christian converts
would be better customers of their goods.

British Retreat

After 1858, however, the policy of hesitant modernisation
was gradually abandoned. However, the Indians proved to be
apt pupils and shifted rapidly towards modernisation of their
society and assertion of their culture and demanded a rule
in accordance with the modern principles of liberty, equality
and justice. Now, the British came to side with the socially
orthodox and conservative elements of society. They also
encouraged casteism and communalism.

British Policy Towards
Princely States
Relations with princely states were to be guided by a twopoint policy—using and perpetuating them as bulwark of the

empire and subordinating them completely to British authority
(the policy of subordinate union).
To cultivate these states as a buffer against future
political unrest and to reward them for their loyalty during
the revolt of 1857, the policy of annexation was abandoned.
The new policy was to depose or punish but not annex. Also,
territorial integrity of states was guaranteed and it was
announced that their right to adopt an heir would be
respected.
The subordination of princely states to British authority
was completed when the fiction of Indian states standing in
a status of equality with the Crown as independent, sovereign
states ended with the Queen adopting the title of Kaiser-iHind (Queen Empress of India) in 1876, to emphasise British
sovereignty over entire India. It was later made clear by Lord
Curzon that the princes ruled their states merely as agents
of the British Crown. With paramountcy, the British
Government exercised the right to interfere in the internal
affairs of states through their residents or by appointing and
dismissing ministers and officials.
The British were helped further in their encroachment
by modern developments in communication—railways, roads,
telegraph, canals, post offices, etc. The motive for interference
was also provided by the rise of nationalist, democratic
sentiments in these states, the suppression of which, the
British realised, was essential for their survival. As a positive
side to these modern political movements, the British helped
these states adopt modern administrative institutions. (Also
refer to chapter on “Indian States under British Rule”.)

British Foreign Policy in India
The pursuance of a foreign policy, guided by interest of
British imperialism, often led to India’s conflicts with
neighbouring countries. These conflicts arose due to various
reasons. Firstly, political and administrative consolidation of

540  

the country coupled with the introduction of modern means
of communication impelled the Government of India to reach
out for natural, geographical frontiers for internal cohesion
and defence which sometimes resulted in border clashes.
Secondly, the British Government had as its major aims in
Asia and Africa—
(i) protection of the invaluable Indian empire;
(ii) expansion of British commercial and economic
interests;
(iii) keeping other European imperialist powers, whose
colonial interests came in conflict with those of
the British, at an arm’s length in Asia and Africa.
These aims led to British expansion and territorial
conquests outside India’s natural frontiers, and to conflicts
with other imperialist European powers such as Russia and
France.
While the interests served were British, the money
spent and the blood shed was Indian.

of India has been made in the chapter on ‘British Expansion
and Consolidation in India’).

Economic Impact of
British Rule in India
The major difference between the British colonists in India
and earlier invaders was that none of the earlier invaders made
any structural changes in Indian economy or drained away
India’s wealth as tribute. British rule in India caused a
transformation of India’s economy into a colonial economy,
i.e., the structure and operation of Indian economy were
determined by the interests of the British economy.
According to historians, at the beginning of the
eighteenth century India had some 23 per cent of the world
economy. This share came down to some 3 per cent when
India got independence.
A detailed survey of the economic impact of British
rule follows.

Deindustrialisation—Ruin of
Artisans and Handicraftsmen
One-Way Free Trade

Cheap and machine-made imports flooded the Indian market
after the Charter Act of 1813 allowing one-way free trade
for the British citizens. On the other hand, Indian products
found it more and more difficult to penetrate the European
markets. Tariffs of nearly 80 per cent were imposed on Indian

textiles so that Indian cloth could no longer be cheap. After
1820, European markets were virtually closed to Indian
exports. Cheap British made cloth flooded the Indian market.
The newly introduced rail network helped the European
products to reach the remotest corners of the country. From
being a net exporter, India became a net importer.

No Steps towards Modern Industrialisation

The loss of traditional livelihood was not accompanied by
a process of industrialisation in India, as had happened in
other rapidly industrialising countries of the time. This
resulted in deindustrialisation of India at a time when Europe
was witnessing a reintensified Industrial Revolution. This
happened at a time when Indian artisans and handicraftsmen
were already feeling the crunch due to loss of patronage by
princes and the nobility, who were now under the influence
of new western tastes and values.

Ruralisation

Another feature of deindustrialisation was the decline of
many cities and a process of ruralisation of India. Many
artisans, faced with diminishing returns and repressive
policies (in Bengal, during the Company’s rule, artisans were
paid low wages and forced to sell their products at low
prices), abandoned their professions, moved to villages and
took to agriculture. This resulted in increased pressure on
land. An overburdened agriculture sector was a major cause
of poverty during British rule and this upset the village
economic set-up.

Impoverishment of Peasantry
The government, only interested in maximisation of rents and
in securing its share of revenue, had enforced the Permanent

… for most of the colonial era, the story of India manufacturing
was of dispossession, displacement and defeat. What happened
to India’s textiles was replicated across the board. From the
great manufacturing nation described by Sunderland, India
became a mere exporter of raw materials and foodstuffs, raw
cotton, as well as jute, silk, coal, opium, rice, spices and tea.
With the collapse of its manufacturing and the elimination of
manufactured goods from its export rosters, India’s share of world
manufacturing exports fell from 27 per cent to 2 per cent under
British rule.

Settlement system in large parts. Transferability of land was
one feature of the new settlement which caused great
insecurity to the tenants who lost all their traditional rights
in land. There was little spending by Government on
improvement of land productivity. The zamindars, with
increased powers, resorted to summary evictions, demanded
illegal dues and ‘begar’ to maximise their share in the
produce and, as such, had no incentive to invest for
improvement of agriculture. The overburdened peasants had
to approach the moneylenders to be able to pay their dues
to the zamindars. The money-lender, who was often also the
village grain-merchant, forced the farmer to sell the produce
at low prices to clear his dues. The powerful money-lender
was also able to manipulate the judiciary and law in his favour.
The peasant turned out to be the ultimate sufferer under
the triple burden of the Government, zamindar and moneylender. His hardship increased at the time of famine and
scarcity. This was as much true for the zamindari areas as
for areas under Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems. The peasant
became landless.

Emergence of Intermediaries,
Absentee Landlordism, Ruin of
Old Zamindars
By 1815, half of the total land in Bengal had passed into
new hands—merchants, moneylenders and other moneyed

544  

classes living in towns. The new zamindars, with increased
powers but with little or no avenues for new investments,
resorted to landgrabbing and sub-infeudation. Increase in
number of intermediaries to be paid gave rise to absentee
landlordism and increased the burden on the peasant. Since
the demand for land was high, prices went up and so did the
liabilities of the peasant. With no traditional or benevolent
ties with the tenants, the zamindar had no incentive to invest
in the improvement of agriculture. The interests of the
zamindars lay only in the perpetuation of British rule and
in opposing the national movement.

Stagnation and Deterioration of
Agriculture
The cultivator had neither the means nor any incentive to
invest in agriculture. The zamindar had no roots in the
villages, while the Government spent little on agricultural,
technical or mass education. All this, together with
fragmentation of land due to sub-infeudation, made it difficult
to introduce modern technology which caused a perpetually
low level of productivity.

Famine and Poverty

Regular recurrence of famines became a common feature of
daily existence in India. These famines were not just because
of foodgrain scarcity, but were a direct result of poverty
unleashed by colonial forces in India. Between 1850 and
1900, about 2.8 crore people died in famines.

Commercialisation of Indian
Agriculture
In the latter half of the nineteenth century, another significant
trend was the emergence of the commercialisation of
agriculture. So far, agriculture had been a way of life rather
than a business enterprise. Now agriculture began to be
influenced by commercial considerations. Certain specialised
crops began to be grown not for consumption in the village
but for sale in the national and even international markets.
Commercial crops like cotton, jute, groundnut, oilseeds,

sugarcane, tobacco, etc., were more remunerative than
foodgrains. Again, the cultivation of crops like condiments,
spices, fruits and vegetables could cater to a wider market.
Perhaps, the commercialisation trend reached the highest
level of development in the plantation sector, i.e., in tea,
coffee, rubber, indigo, etc., which was mostly owned by
Europeans and the produce was for sale in a wider market.
The new market trend of commercialisation and
specialisation was encouraged by many factors—spread of
money economy, replacement of custom and tradition by
competition and contract, emergence of a unified national
market, growth of internal trade, improvement in
communications through rail and roads and boost to
international trade given by entry of British finance capital,
etc.
For the Indian peasant, commercialisation seemed a
forced process. There was hardly any surplus for him to
invest in commercial crops, given the subsistence level at
which he lived, while commercialisation linked Indian
agriculture with international market trends and their
fluctuations. For instance, the cotton of the 1860s pushed
up prices but this mostly benefited the intermediaries, and
when the slump in prices came in 1866, it hit the cultivators
the most, bringing in its turn heavy indebtedness, famine and
agrarian riots in the Deccan in the 1870s. Thus, the cultivator
hardly emerged better from the new commercialisation trend.

Destruction of Industry
and Late Development of
Modern Industry
Indian industry was steadily destroyed. The destruction of
textile competition of India is a glaring example of the de-

546  

industrialisation of India. The British stopped paying for
Indian textiles in pounds, choosing instead to pay from the
revenue gained from Bengal and at very low rates, thus
impoverishing the peasants further.
A thriving ship-building industry was crushed. Surat and
Malabar on the western coast and Bengal and Masulipatnam
on the eastern coast were known for their ship-building
industries. The British ships contracted by the Company were
given a monopoly over trade routes, while even the Indian
merchant ships plying along the coast were made to face
heavy duties. In 1813, a law by the British parliament
prohibited ships below 350 tonnes from sailing between India
to Britain; this effectively put a large proportion of Bengalbuilt ships out of commission on the Indo-British trade
routes. In 1814, another law was passed under which Indianbuilt ships were refused to be considered ‘British-registered
vessels’ which could trade with America and the European
continent. So the decline of the Indian shipping industry was
ensured.
The British did not allow the Indian steel industry to
grow. Industries like the Tatas which began to produce steel
after a lot of trouble getting the required permissions were
restricted by being forced to produce a higher standard of
steel for British use. The firms were not able to produce
the lower standard of steel at the same time, so they were
left out of the larger market that demanded the lower quality
of steel. As restrictions were placed by Britain on Indian steel
imports, this steel could only be used in India. Obviously,
the growth of the industry was hampered.
Indian traders, moneylenders and bankers had amassed
some wealth as junior partners of English merchant capitalists
in India. Their role fitted in the British scheme of colonial
exploitation. The Indian moneylender provided loans to
hardpressed agriculturists and thus facilitated the state
collection of revenue. The Indian trader carried imported
British products to the remotest corners and helped in the
movement of Indian agricultural products for exports. The
indigenous bankers helped both in the process of distribution
and collection. But, the colonial situation retarded the
development of a healthy and independent industrial

Economic Impact of British Rule in India

 547

bourgeoisie, and its development was different from other
independent countries like Germany and Japan.
It was only in the second half of the nineteenth century
that modern machine-based industries started coming up in
India. The first cotton textile mill was set up in 1853 in
Bombay by Cowasjee Nanabhoy and the first jute mill came
up in 1855 in Rishra (Bengal). But most of the modern
industries were foreign-owned and controlled by British
managing agencies.
There was a rush of foreign capital in India at this time
due to prospects of high profits, availability of cheap labour,
cheap and readily available raw material, ready market in India
and the neighbours, diminishing avenues for investments at
home, willingness of the administration to provide all help,
and ready markets abroad for some Indian exports such as
tea, jute and manganese.
Indian-owned industries came up in cotton textiles and
jute in the nineteenth century and in sugar, cement, etc., in
the twentieth century. Indian-owned industries suffered from
many handicaps—credit problems, no tariff protection by
Government, unequal competition from foreign companies,
and stiff opposition from British capitalist interests who were
backed by sound financial and technical infrastructure at
home.
The colonial factor also caused certain structural and
institutional changes. The industrial development was
characterised by a lopsided pattern—core and heavy industries
and power generation were neglected and some regions were
favoured more than the others—causing regional disparities.
These regional disparities hampered the process of nationbuilding. In the absence of careful nurturing of technical
View
…deindustrialisation was a deliberate British policy, not an
accident. British industry flourished and Indian industry did not

regulatory measures that stacked the decks in favour of British
industry conquering the Indian market, rather than the other way
around.
—Shashi Tharoor in An Era of Darkness

548  

education, the industry lacked sufficient technical manpower.
Socially, the rise of an industrial capitalist class and the
working class was an important feature of this phase.

Nationalist Critique of
Colonial Economy
The early intellectuals of the first half of the nineteenth
century supported British rule under the impression that it
would modernise the country based on latest technology and
capitalist economic organisation. After the 1860s,
disillusionment started to set in among the politically conscious
and they began to probe into the reality of British rule in
India.
The foremost among these economic analysts was
Dadabhai Naoroji, the ‘Grand Old Man of India’, who after
a brilliant analysis of the colonial economy put forward the
theory of economic drain in Poverty and UnBritish Rule
in India. Other economic analysts included Justice Mahadeo
Govind Ranade, Romesh Chandra Dutt (The Economic History
Economic Drain
The term ‘economic drain’ refers to a portion of national product
of India which was not available for consumption of its peoples,
but was being drained away to Britain for political reasons and India
was not getting adequate economic or material returns for it. The
drain theory was put forward by Dadabhai Naoroji in his book Poverty
and UnBritish Rule in India. The major components of this drain
were salaries and pensions of civil and military officials, interests
on loans taken by the Indian Government from abroad, profits on
foreign investment in India, stores purchased in Britain for civil and
military departments, payments to be made for shipping, banking
and insurance services which stunted the growth of Indian enterprise
in these services.
The drain of wealth checked and retarded capital formation in
India while the same portion of wealth accelerated the growth of
British economy. The surplus from British economy re-entered India
as finance capital, further draining India of its wealth. This had
immense effect on income and employment potential within India.

of India), Gopal Krishna Gokhale, G. Subramaniya Iyer and
Prithwishchandra Ray. The essence of nineteenth century
colonialism, they said, lay in the transformation of India into
a supplier of foodstuffs and raw-materials to the metropolis,
a market for metropolitan manufacturers and a field for
investment of British capital. These early nationalist analysts
organised intellectual agitations and advocated a complete
severance of India’s economic subservience to Britain and
the development of an independent economy based on
modern industries.

British Policies Making India Poor

The basic assertion of these early intellectuals was that India
was poor and growing poorer due to British imperialism, and
since the causes of India’s economic backwardness were
man-made, they were explainable and removable. The problem
of poverty was seen as a problem of raising productive
capacity and energy of the people or as a problem of national
development, thus making poverty a national issue. This
helped in rallying all sections of society around common
economic issues. Also, development was equated with
industrialisation. This industrialisation was to be based on
Indian and not foreign capital because, according to the early
nationalists, foreign capital replaced and suppressed instead
of augmenting and encouraging Indian capital. This suppression
caused economic drain, further strengthening British hold
over India. The political consequences of foreign capital
investments were equally harmful as they caused political
subjugation and created vested interests which sought security
for investors, thus perpetuating the foreign rule.

Growth of Trade and Railways to
Help Britain

These analysts exposed the force of British arguments that
the growth of foreign trade and railways implied development
for India. They pointed out that the pattern of foreign trade
was unfavourable to India. It relegated India to a position of
importer of finished goods and exporter of raw materials and
foodstuffs. The development of railways, they argued, was
not coordinated with India’s industrial needs and it ushered
in a commercial rather than an industrial revolution. The net

effect of the railways was to enable foreign goods to outsell
indigenous products. Further, the benefits from impetus to
steel, machinery and capital investment in railways accrued
to the British. G.V. Joshi remarked, “Expenditure on railways
should be seen as an Indian subsidy to British industries.”

One-Way Free Trade and Tariff Policy

The nationalists claimed that one-way free trade was ruining
Indian handicrafts industry, exposing it to premature, unequal
and unfair competition, while tariff policy was guided by
British capitalist interests. On the finance front, taxes were
levied to overburden the poor, sparing British capitalists and
the bureaucrats. They demanded reduction of land revenue,
abolition of salt tax, imposition of income tax and excise
duties on consumer goods consumed by the rich middle
classes. The government expenditure, it was argued, was
meant to serve colonial needs only, while development and
welfare were ignored.

Effect of Economic Drain

The drain theory incorporated all threads of the nationalist
critique that it denuded India of its productive capital.

time was—

one third of the total savings (in today’s terms, it
amounted to 8 per cent of the national product).
The concept of drain—one country taking away wealth
from another country—was easily grasped by a nation of
peasants for whom exploitation was a matter of daily
experience.

Economic Issue a Stimulant to
National Unrest
The nationalist agitation on economic issues served to
undermine the ideological hegemony of alien rulers over
Indian minds that the foreign rule was in the interest of
Indians, thus exposing the myth of its moral foundations. It
was also shown clearly that India was poor because it was
being ruled for British interests. This agitation was one of
the stimulants for intellectual unrest and spread of national
consciousness during the moderate phase of freedom struggle
(1875-1905)—the seed-time of national movement.
Till the end of the 19th century, the nationalists had
been demanding some share in political power and control
over the purse. During the first decade of the 20th century,
they started demanding self-rule, like United Kingdom or the
colonies, and prominent among such nationalists was Dadabhai
Naoroji.

Stages of Colonialism in India
The fundamental character of British rule in India did not
remain the same through its long history of nearly two
centuries. The changing pattern of Britain’s position in the
world economy led to changes in the nature of British
colonialism. Marxist Historians, especially Rajni Palme Dutt,
identified three overlapping stages in the history of imperialist
rule in India. He points out that each stage developed out
of the conditions of the previous stage and the different
modes of colonial exploitation overlapped—old forms of
colonial exploitation never entirely ceased but got integrated
into new patterns of exploitation. These stages are, however,

Economic Impact of British Rule in India

 553

marked by distinct dominant features i.e., qualitative changes
from one stage to another.

First Stage

The Period of Merchant Capital (Mercantilism), often
described as the Period of Monopoly Trade and Direct
Appropriation (or the Period of East India Company’s
Domination, 1757-1813), was based on two basic objectives—
(i) to acquire a monopoly of trade with India, against other
English or European merchants or trading companies as well
as against the Indian merchants; (ii) to directly appropriate
or take over governmental revenues through control over
State power.
During this period no basic changes were introduced
in administration, judicial system, transport and
communication, methods of agricultural or industrial
production, forms of business management or economic
organisation. Nor were any major changes made in education
or intellectual field, culture or social organisation. In fact,
the traditional Indian civilisation, religions, laws, caste system,
family structure, etc., were not seen as obstacles in the
colonial exploitation.
The only changes made were:
(i) in military organisation and technology which
native rulers were also introducing in their armed
forces, and
(ii) in administration at the top of the structure of
revenue collection so that it could become more
efficient and smooth.
In this phase there was large scale drain of wealth from
India which constituted 2-3 per cent of Britain’s national
income at the time. It was this wealth that played an important
role in financing Britain’s industrial revolution.
In this stage there was no large scale import of British
manufactures into India, rather, the reverse occurred—there
was an increase in export of Indian textiles, etc. The weavers
were, however, ruined at this stage by the Company’s
monopoly and exploitation. They were forced to produce for
the Company under uneconomic compulsions.

554  

Second Stage

Owing to its mode of exploitation being trade, this stage is
also termed as Colonialism of Free Trade. It started with the
Charter Act of 1813 and continued till 1860s. Soon after
the East India Company became the ruler over most parts
of India, there was a debate in Britain as to whose interests
the newly acquired colony would serve. The newly emerging
industrial capitalists began to criticise the East India Company
and its exploitation of India. They demanded that colonial
administration and policy in India should now serve British
capitalist interests which were very different from those of
the East India Company. Now India was to serve as a market
for the ever increasing output of British manufactured goods
especially textiles. At the same time, the new capitalists in
England, needed from India exports of raw materials, especially
cotton, and foodgrains. Moreover, India could buy more
British goods only if it earned foreign exchange by enhancing
its exports.
The export of raw materials was increased sharply to
meet the dividends of the Company and profits of British
merchants. Besides, there was a need of money to pay for
pensions of British officials who would go to Britain after
retirement.
In this phase the following dominant features were
visible:
(i) India’s colonial economy was integrated with the
British and world capitalist economy. This was made possible
with the introduction of free trade. All import duties in India
were either totally removed or drastically reduced to nominal
rates.
(ii) Free entry was also granted to the British capitalists
to develop tea, coffee and indigo plantations, trade, transport,
mining and modern industries in India. The British Indian
Government gave active State help to such capitalists.
(iii) The Permanent Settlement and the Ryotwari system
in agriculture were introduced to transform traditional agrarian
structure into a capitalist one.
(iv) Administration was made more comprehensive and
included villages and outlying areas of the country. These
changes were brought about to make British goods reach, and

Economic Impact of British Rule in India

 555

agricultural products drawn from, interior villages and remotest
parts.
(v) Personal law was largely left untouched since it did
not affect colonial transformation of the economy. However,
the changes related to criminal law, law of contract and legal
procedures were overhauled to promote capitalist commercial
relations and maintain law and order.
(vi) Modern education was introduced to provide cheap
manpower to the vastly expanded administration. However,
it was also aimed at transforming India’s society and culture
for two reasons: (a) create an overall atmosphere of change
and development and, (b) give birth to a culture of loyalty
to the rulers.
(vii) The taxation and the burden on peasant rose sharply
due to economic transformation and costly administration
(civil as well as military).
(viii) India absorbed 10 to 12 per cent of British
exports and nearly 20 per cent of Britain’s textile exports.
After 1850, engine coaches, rail lines and other railway
stores were imported into India at large scale.
(ix) Indian army was used for British expansion of
colonialism in Asia and Africa.

Third Stage

The third stage is often described as the Era of Foreign
Investments and International Competition for Colonies. It
began around the 1860s in India owing to several changes
in the world economy. These changes were as follows.
(i) Britain’s industrial supremacy was challenged by
several countries of Europe, the United States and Japan.
(ii) As a result of the application of scientific knowledge
to industry, the pace of industrialisation increased sharply
(use of petroleum as fuel for the internal combustion engine
and the use of electricity for industrial purposes were
significant innovations).
(iii) The world market became more unified due to
revolution in the means of international transport.
During this stage, Britain made strenuous efforts to
consolidate its control over India. Liberal imperialist policies
got replaced with reactionary imperialist policies which were
reflected in the viceroyalties of Lytton, Dufferin, Lansdowne

556  

and Curzon. The strengthening of colonial rule over India was
meant to keep out the rivals as well as to attract British
capital to India and provide it security. As a result, a very
large amount of British capital got invested in railways, loans
(to the Government of India), trade and, to a lesser extent,
in plantations, coal mining, jute mills, shipping and banking
in India.
The notion of training the Indian people for selfgovernment vanished (revived only after 1918 because of
pressure exerted by the Indian national movement). Now, the
aim of British rule was declared as permanent ‘trusteeship’
over the Indians. The Indians were declared to be permanently
immature—a ‘child’ people—needing British control and
trusteeship. Geography, climate, race, history, religion, culture
and social organisation were all cited as factors in making
the Indians unfit for self-government or democracy. The
British thus tried to justify their rule over Indians for
centuries to come—all in the name of civilising a barbaric
people—“the White Man’s burden”.

Development of Indian Press

 557

Chapter 29

Development of
Indian Press
James Augustus Hickey in 1780 started The Bengal Gazette
or Calcutta General Advertiser, the first newspaper in India,
which was seized in 1872 because of its outspoken criticism
of the Government. Later more newspapers/journals came
up—The Bengal Journal, The Calcutta Chronicle, The
Madras Courier, The Bombay Herald. The Company’s
officers were worried that these newspapers might reach
London and expose their misdeeds. Thus they saw the need
for curbs on the press.

Early Regulations
Censorship of Press Act, 1799
Lord Wellesley enacted this, anticipating French invasion of
India. It imposed almost wartime press restrictions including
pre-censorship. These restrictions were relaxed under Lord
Hastings, who had progressive views, and in 1818, precensorship was dispensed with.
Licensing Regulations, 1823
The acting governor-general, John Adams, who had reactionary
views, enacted these. According to these regulations, starting
or using a press without licence was a penal offence. Later
on, the Act was extended to cover journals, pamphlets and
books. These restrictions were directed chiefly against Indian
language newspapers or those edited by Indians. Rammohan
Roy’s Mirat-ul-Akbar had to stop publication.
557

558  

Press Act of 1835 or Metcalfe Act
Metcalfe (governor-general—1835-36) repealed the
obnoxious 1823 ordinance and earned the epithet, “liberator
of the Indian press”. The new Press Act (1835) required a
printer/publisher to give a precise account of premises of
a publication and cease functioning, if required by a similar
declaration.
The result of a liberal press policy was a rapid growth
of newspapers.
Licensing Act, 1857
Due to the emergency caused by the 1857 revolt, this Act
imposed licensing restrictions in addition to the already
existing registration procedure laid down by Metcalfe Act
and the government reserved the right to stop publication and
circulation of any book, newspaper or printed matter.
Registration Act, 1867
This replaced Metcalfe’s Act of 1835 and was of a regulatory,
not restrictive, nature. As per the Act, (i) every book/
newspaper was required to print the name of the printer and
the publisher and the place of the publication; and (ii) a copy
was to be submitted to the local government within one
month of the publication of a book.

Struggle by Early Nationalists
to Secure Press Freedom
Right from the early nineteenth century, defence of civil
liberties, including the freedom of the press, had been high
on nationalist agenda. As early as 1824, Raja Rammohan Roy
had protested against a resolution restricting the freedom of
the press.
The early phase of nationalist movement from around
1870 to 1918 focussed more on political propaganda and
education, formation and propagation of nationalist ideology
and arousing, training, mobilisation and consolidation of
public opinion, than on mass agitation or active mobilisation
of masses through open meetings. For this purpose the press
proved a crucial tool in the hands of the nationalists. The
Indian National Congress in its early days relied solely on
the press to propagate its resolutions and proceedings.
Many newspapers emerged during these years under
distinguished and fearless journalists. These included The
Hindu and Swadesamitran under G. Subramaniya Aiyar, The

Development of Indian Press

 559

Bengalee under Surendranath Banerjea, Voice of India under
Dadabhai Naoroji, Amrita Bazar Patrika under Sisir Kumar
Ghosh and Motilal Ghosh, Indian Mirror under N.N. Sen,
Kesari (in Marathi) and Maharatta (in English) under
Balgangadhar Tilak, Sudharak under Gopal Ganesh Agarkar,
and Hindustan and Advocate under G.P. Verma. Other main
newspapers included, Tribune and Akbhar-i-am in Punjab,
Gujarati, Indu Prakash, Dhyan Prakash and Kal in Bombay
and Som Prakash, Banganivasi and Sadharani in Bengal.
These newspapers were not established as profitmaking business ventures but were seen as rendering national
and public service. In fact, these newspapers had a wide reach
and they stimulated a library movement. Their impact was
not limited to cities and towns; these newspapers reached
the remote villages, where each news item and editorial
would be read and discussed thoroughly in the ‘local libraries’
which would gather around a single newspaper. In this way,
these libraries served the purpose of not only political
education but also of political participation. In these
newspapers, government Acts and policies were put to critical
scrutiny. They acted as an institution of opposition to the
government.
The government on its part had enacted many strident
laws, such as Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code which
provided that anyone trying to cause disaffection against the
British Government in India was to be transported for life
or for any term or imprisoned up to three years. But the
nationalist-minded journalists had evolved many clever
strategems to subvert these legal hurdles. For instance,
writings hostile to the government used to be prefaced with
sentiments of loyalty to the government or critical writings
of socialists or Irish nationalists from newspapers in England
used to be quoted. This was a difficult task which required
an intelligent mix of simplicity with subtlety.
The national movement, from its very beginning, stood
for the freedom of press. The Indian newspapers became
highly critical of Lord Lytton’s administration especially
regarding its inhuman treatment to victims of the famine of
1876-77. The Government struck back with the Vernacular
Press Act, 1878.

Vernacular Press Act, 1878

A bitter legacy of the 1857 revolt was the racial bitterness
between the ruler and the ruled. After 1858, the European

560  

press always rallied behind the government in political
controversies while the vernacular press was critical of the
government. There was a strong public opinion against the
imperialistic policies of Lytton, compounded by terrible
famine (1876-77), on the one hand, and lavish expenditure
on the imperial Delhi Durbar, on the other.
The Vernacular Press Act (VPA) was designed to
‘better control’ the vernacular press and effectively punish
and repress seditious writing. The provisions of the Act
included the following.
1. The district magistrate was empowered to call upon
the printer and publisher of any vernacular newspaper to enter
into a bond with the government undertaking not to cause
disaffection against the government or antipathy
between persons of different religions, caste, race through
published material; the printer and publisher could also be
required to deposit security which could be forefeited if the
regulation were contravened, and press equipment could be
seized if the offence re-occurred.
2. The magistrate’s action was final and no appeal could
be made in a court of law.
3. A vernacular newspaper could get exemption from
the operation of the Act by submitting proofs to a government
censor.
The Act came to be nicknamed “the gagging Act”. The
worst features of this Act were—(i) discrimination between
English and vernacular press, (ii) no right of appeal.
Under VPA, proceedings were instituted against Som
Prakash, Bharat Mihir, Dacca Prakash and Samachar.
(Incidentally, the Amrita Bazar Patrika turned overnight
into an English newspaper to escape the VPA.)
Later, the pre-censorship clause was repealed, and a
press commissioner was appointed to supply authentic and
accurate news to the press.
There was strong opposition to the Act and finally
Ripon repealed it in 1882.
In 1883, Surendranath Banerjea became the first
Indian journalist to be imprisoned. In an angry editorial
in The Bengalee Banerjea had criticised a judge of Calcutta
High Court for being insensitive to the religious sentiments
of Bengalis in one of his judgements.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak is most frequently associated with
the nationalist fight for the freedom of press. Tilak had been

Development of Indian Press

 561

building up anti-imperialist sentiments among the public
through Ganapati festivals (started in 1893), Shivaji festivals
(started in 1896) and through his newspapers Kesari and
Maharatta. He was among the first to advocate bringing the
lower middle classes, the peasants, artisans and workers into
the Congress fold. In 1896, he organised an all Maharashtra
campaign for boycott of foreign cloth in opposition to
imposition of excise duty on cotton. In 1896-97 he initiated
a no-tax campaign in Maharashtra, urging farmers to withhold
the payment of revenue if their crop had failed. In 1897,
plague occurred in Poona. Although Tilak supported
government measures to check plague, there was large-scale
popular resentment against heartless and harsh methods such
as segregation and house searches. The popular unrest
resulted in murder of the chairman of the Plague Committee
in Poona by the Chapekar brothers. The government policies
on tariff, currency and famine were also behind this popular
resentment.
The government had been looking for an opportunity
to check this militant trend and hostility in the press. They
decided to make Tilak a victim to set an example to the
public. Tilak was arrested after the murder of Rand on the
basis of the publication of a poem, ‘Shivaji’s Utterances’, in
Kesari, and a speech which Tilak had delivered at the Shivaji
festival, justifying Afzal Khan’s murder by Shivaji. Tilak’s
defence of Shivaji’s killing of Afzal Khan was portrayed by
the prosecution as an incitement to kill British officials. Tilak
was held guilty and awarded rigorous imprisonment of
eighteen months. Simultaneously several other editors in
Bombay presidency were tried and given similar harsh
sentences. There were widespread protests against these
measures. Overnight Tilak became a national hero and was
given the title of ‘Lokmanya’ (respected and honoured by the
people)—a new leader who preached with his deeds.
In 1898, the government amended Section 124A and
added another Section 153A which made it a criminal offence
for anyone to bring into contempt the Government of India
or to create hatred among different classes, that is, vis-avis the English in India. This also led to nation-wide protests.
During Swadeshi and Boycott Movements and due to rise of
militant nationalist trends, several repressive laws were
passed.

Bal Gangadhar Tilak

Newspaper (Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908 Aimed
against Extremist nationalist activity, the Act empowered the
magistrates to confiscate press property which published
objectionable material likely to cause incitement to murder/
acts of violence.
Tilak as the leader of militant nationalists was tried on
charges of sedition and transported to Mandalay (Burma) for
six years. This led to countrywide protests. In Bombay, textile
workers and railway workshop workers took on the Army in
streets and went on strike for days. Lenin hailed this as the
entrance of the Indian working class on the political stage.
Indian Press Act, 1910 This Act revived the worst
features of the VPA—local government was empowered to
demand a security at registration from the printer/publisher
and fortfeit/deregister if it was an offending newspaper, and
the printer of a newspaper was required to submit two copies
of each issue to local government free of charge.

During and After the
First World War
Defence of India Rules were imposed for repression of
political agitation and free public criticism during the First
World War. In 1921, on the recommendations of a Press
Committee chaired by Tej Bahadur Sapru, the Press Acts of
1908 and 1910 were repealed.
Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931 This
Act gave sweeping powers to provincial governments to
suppress propaganda for Civil Disobedience Movement. It
was further amplified in 1932 to include all activities
calculated to undermine government authority.

During the Second World War

Under the Defence of India Rules, pre-censorship was
imposed and amendments made in Press Emergency Act and
Official Secrets Act. At one time, publication of all news
related to Congress activity was declared illegal.

Chapter 30

Development of
Education
Under Company Rule
For the first 60 years of its dominion in India, the East India
Company, a trading and profit-making concern, took no
interest in the promotion of education. Some minor exceptions
were efforts by individuals—
● The Calcutta Madrasah was established by Warren
Hastings in 1781 for the study of Muslim law and related
subjects.
● The Sanskrit College was established by Jonathan
Duncan, the resident, at Benaras in 1791 for study of Hindu
law and philosophy.
● Fort William College was set up by Wellesley in
1800 for training of civil servants of the Company in
languages and customs of Indians (closed in 1802).
The Calcutta Madrasah and the Sanskrit College were
designed to provide a regular supply of qualified Indians to
help the administration of law in the Company’s court, and
the knowledge of classical languages and vernaculars was
useful in correspondence with Indian states.
Enlightened Indians and missionaries started exerting
pressure on the Government to promote modern, secular,
Western education, as they thought that Western education
was the remedy for social, economic and political ills of the
country. Missionaries thought that modern education would
563

564  

destroy the faith of Indians in their own religions and they
would take to Christianity. Serampore missionaries were, in
particular, very enthusiastic about spread of education.

A Humble beginning by
Charter Act of 1813

The Charter Act of 1813 incorporated the principle of
encouraging learned Indians and promoting knowledge of
modern sciences in the country. The Act directed the
Company to sanction one lakh rupees annually for this
purpose. However, even this petty amount was not made
available till 1823, mainly because of the controversy raged
on the question of the direction that this expenditure should
take.
Meanwhile, efforts of enlightened Indians such as Raja
Rammohan Roy bore fruit and a grant was sanctioned for
Calcutta College set up in 1817 by educated Bengalis,
imparting English education in Western humanities and
sciences. The government also set up three Sanskrit colleges
at Calcutta, Delhi and Agra.

Orientalist-Anglicist Controversy

Within the General Committee on Public Instruction, the
Anglicists argued that the government spending on education
should be exclusively for modern studies.
The Orientalists said while Western sciences and literature should be taught to prepare students to take up jobs,
emphasis should be placed on expansion of traditional Indian
learning.
Even the Anglicists were divided over the question of
medium of instruction—one faction was for English language
as the medium, while the other faction was for Indian
languages (vernaculars) for the purpose.
Unfortunately there was a great deal of confusion over
English and vernacular languages as media of instruction and
as objects of study.

Lord Macaulay’s Minute (1835)

The famous Lord Macaulay’s Minute settled the row in favour
of Anglicists—the limited government resources were to be
devoted to teaching of Western sciences and literature

Development of Education

 565

through the medium of English language alone. Lord Macaulay
held the view that “Indian learning was inferior to European
learning”—which was true as far as physical and social
sciences in the contemporary stage were concerned.
The government soon made English as the medium of
instruction in its schools and colleges and opened a few
English schools and colleges instead of a large number of
elementary schools, thus neglecting mass education. The
British planned to educate a small section of upper and
middle classes, thus creating a class “Indian in blood and
colour but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in
intellect” who would act as interpreters between the
government and masses and would enrich the vernaculars by
which knowledge of Western sciences and literature would
reach the masses. This was called the ‘downward filtration
theory’.
Modern ideas, if not education, did filter down to the
masses, though not in a form desired by the rulers, but
through political parties, press, pamphlets, public platforms,
etc. Modern education only helped this process by making
available the basic literature on physical and social sciences
to nationalists, thus stimulating their capacity to make social
analysis—otherwise the content, structure and curricula of
modern education served colonial interests.

Efforts of Thomson

James Thomson, lieutenant-governor of NW Provinces (184353), developed a comprehensive scheme of village education
through the medium of vernacular languages. In these village
schools, useful subjects such as mensuration and agriculture
sciences were taught. The purpose was to train personnel for
the newly set up Revenue and Public Works Department.

Wood’s Despatch (1854)

In 1854, Charles Wood prepared a despatch on an educational
system for India. Considered the “Magna Carta of English
Education in India”, this document was the first comprehensive
plan for the spread of education in India.
1. It asked the government of India to assume
responsibility for education of the masses, thus repudiating
the ‘downward filtration theory’, at least on paper.

566  

2. It systematised the hierarchy from vernacular primary
schools in villages at bottom, followed by Anglo-Vernacular
High Schools and an affiliated college at the district level,
and affiliating universities in the presidency towns of Calcutta,
Bombay and Madras.
3. It recommended English as the medium of instruction
for higher studies and vernaculars at school level.
4. It laid stress on female and vocational education, and
on teachers’ training.
5. It laid down that the education imparted in government
institutions should be secular.
6. It recommended a system of grants-in-aid to
encourage private enterprise.
Developments
In 1857, universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were
set up and later, departments of education were set up in all
provinces. The Bethune School founded by J.E.D. Bethune
at Calcutta (1849) was the first fruit of a powerful movement
for education of women which arose in 1840s and 1850s.
Bethune was the president of the Council of Education.
Mostly due to Bethune’s efforts, girls’ schools were set up
on a sound footing and brought under government’s grantsin-aid and inspection system.
An Agriculture Institute at Pusa (Bihar) and an
Engineering Institute at Roorkee were started.
The ideals and methods of Wood’s Despatch dominated
the field for five decades which saw rapid westernisation of
education system in India, with educational institutions run
by European headmasters and principals. Missionary
enterprises played their own part. Gradually, private Indian
effort appeared in the field.

After the Crown Took Over
Hunter Education Commission (1882-83)

Earlier schemes had neglected primary and secondary
education. When education was shifted to provinces in 1870,
primary and secondary education further suffered because the
provinces already had limited resources at their disposal. In
1882, the Government appointed a commission under the
chairmanship of W.W. Hunter to review the progress of

Development of Education

 567

education in the country since the Despatch of 1854. The
Hunter Commission mostly confined its recommendations to
primary and secondary education. The commission—
(i) emphasised that state’s special care is required for
extension and improvement of primary education,
and that primary education should be imparted
through vernacular.
(ii) recommended transfer of control of primary
education to newly set up district and municipal
boards.
(iii) recommended that secondary (High School)
education should have two divisions—
● literary—leading up to university.
● vocational—for commercial careers.
(iv) drew attention to inadequate facilities for female
education, especially outside presidency towns
and made recommendations for its spread.
The next two decades saw rapid growth and expansion
of secondary and collegiate education with the participation
of Indians. Also, more teaching-cum-examining universities
were set up like the Punjab University (1882) and the
Allahabad University (1887).

Indian Universities Act, 1904

The dawn of 20th century saw political unrest. The official
view was that under private management the quality of
education had deteriorated and educational institutions acted
as factories producing political revolutionaries. Nationalists
accepted the decline in quality but accused the Government
of not doing anything to eradicate illiteracy.
In 1902, Raleigh Commission was set up to go into
conditions and prospects of universities in India and to
suggest measures for improvement in their constitution and
working. The commission precluded from reporting on
primary or secondary education. Based on its
recommendations, the Indian Universities Act was passed in
1904. As per the Act,
(i) universities were to give more attention to study
and research;
(ii) the number of fellows of a university and their
period in office were reduced and most fellows
were to be nominated by the Government;

568  

(iii) Government was to have powers to veto
universities’ senate regulations and could amend
these regulations or pass regulations on its own;
(iv) conditions were to be made stricter for affiliation
of private colleges; and
(v) five lakh rupees were to be sanctioned per annum
for five years for improvement of higher education
and universities.
Curzon justified greater control over universities in the
name of quality and efficiency, but actually sought to restrict
education and to discipline the educated towards loyalty to
the Government.
The nationalists saw in it an attempt to strengthen
imperialism and to sabotage nationalist feelings. Gokhale
called it a “retrograde measure”.

Government Resolution on Education
Policy—1913

In 1906, the progressive state of Baroda introduced
compulsory primary education throughout its territories.
National leaders urged the government to do so for British
India (Gokhale made a powerful advocacy for it in the
Legislative Assembly).
In its 1913 Resolution on Education Policy, the
government refused to take up the responsibility of compulsory
education, but accepted the policy of removal of illiteracy
and urged provincial governments to take early steps to
provide free elementary education to the poorer and more
backward sections. Private efforts were to be encouraged for
this and the quality of secondary schools was to be improved.
A university, it was decided, was to be established in each
province and teaching activities of universities were to be
encouraged.

Saddler University Commission (1917-19)

The commission was set up to study and report on problems
of Calcutta University but its recommendations were
applicable more or less to other universities also. It reviewed
the entire field from school education to university education.
It held the view that, for the improvement of university
education, improvement of secondary education was a
necessary pre-condition. Its observations were as follows:

Development of Education

 569

1. School course should cover 12 years. Students
should enter university after an intermediate stage (rather
than matric) for a three-year degree course in university. This
was done to
(a) prepare students for university stage;
(b) relieve universities of a large number of below
university standard students; and
(c) provide collegiate education to those not planning
to go through university stage.
A separate board of secondary and intermediate education
should be set up for administration and control of secondary
and intermediate education.
2. There should be less rigidity in framing university
regulations.
3. A university should function as centralised, unitary
residential-teaching autonomous body, rather than as scattered,
affiliated colleges.
4. Female education, applied scientific and technological
education, teachers’ training including those for professional
and vocational colleges should be extended.
In the period from 1916 to 1921 seven new universities
came up at Mysore, Patna, Benaras, Aligarh, Dacca, Lucknow
and Osmania.
In 1920, the Government recommended Saddler report
to the provincial governments.

Education Under Dyarchy

Under Montagu-Chelmsford reforms education was shifted
to provincial ministries and the government stopped taking
direct interest in educational matters, while government
grants, liberally sanctioned since 1902, were now stopped.
Financial difficulties prevented any substantial expansion
but still education grew, especially under philanthropic
efforts.

Hartog Committee (1929)

An increase in number of schools and colleges had led to
deterioration of education standards. The Hartog Committee
was set up to report on development of education. Its main
recommendations were as follows.
1. Emphasis should be given to primary education but
there need be no hasty expansion or compulsion in education.

570  

2. Only deserving students should go in for high school
and intermediate stage, while average students should be
diverted to vocational courses after VIII standard.
3. For improvements in standards of university
education, admissions should be restricted.

Sergeant Plan of Education

The Sergeant Plan (Sergeant was the educational advisor to
the Government) was worked out by the Central Advisory
Board of Education in 1944. It recommended—
1. pre-primary education for 3-6 years age group; free,
Wardha Scheme of Basic Education (1937)
The Congress had organised a National Conference on Education
in October 1937 in Wardha. In the light of the resolutions passed
there, Zakir Hussain committee formulated a detailed national
scheme for basic education. The main principle behind this scheme
was ‘learning through activity’. It was based on Gandhi’s ideas
published in a series of articles in the weekly Harijan. Gandhi thought
that Western education had created a gulf between the educated
few and the masses and had also made the educated elite
ineffective. The scheme had the following provisions.
(i) Inclusion of a basic handicraft in the syllabus.
(ii) First seven years of schooling to be an integral part of
a free and compulsory nationwide education system (through mother
tongue).
(iii) Teaching to be in Hindi from class II to VII and in English
only after class VIII.
(iv) Ways to be devised to establish contact with the
community around schools through service.
(v) A suitable technique to be devised with a view to
implementing the main idea of basic education—educating the child
through the medium of productive activity of a suitable handicraft.
The system, rather than being a methodology for
education, was an expression of an idea for a new life and a new
society. The basic premise was that only through such a scheme
could India be an independent and non-violent society. This scheme
was child-centred and cooperative.
There was not much development of this idea, because of
the start of the Second World War and the resignation of the
Congress ministries (October 1939).

Development of Education

 571

universal and compulsory elementary education for
6-11 years age group; high school education for 1117 years age group for selected children, and a
university course of 3 years after higher secondary;
high schools to be of two types: (i) academic and
(ii) technical and vocational.
2. adequate technical, commercial and arts education.
3. abolition of intermediate course.
4. liquidation of adult illiteracy in 20 years.
5. stress on teachers’ training, physical education,
education for the physically and mentally
handicapped.
The objective was to create within 40 years, the same
level of educational attainment as prevailed in England.
Although a bold and comprehensive scheme, it proposed no
methodology for implementation. Also, the ideal of England’s
achievements may not have suited Indian conditions.

Development of Vernacular
Education
During the early 19th century vernacular education was in
a sorry state of affairs. It was mostly dependent on
contributions from wealthy zamindars.
1835, 1836, 1838 : William Adam’s reports on
vernacular education in Bengal and Bihar pointed out defects
in the system of vernacular education.
1843-53 : James Jonathan’s experiments in NorthWest Provinces (UP), as the lieutenant-governor there,
included opening one government school as model school
in each tehsildari and a normal school for teachers’ training
for vernacular schools.
1853 : In a famous minute, Lord Dalhousie expressed
strong opinion in favour of vernacular education.
1854 : Wood’s Despatch made the following provisions
for vernacular education:
1. Improvement of standards
2. Supervision by government agency
3. Normal schools to train teachers

572  

These gave impetus to the cause of vernacular education
1854-71 : The government paid some attention to
secondary and vernacular education. The number of vernacular schools increased by more than five-fold.
1882 : The Hunter Commission held that State should
make special efforts for extension and improvement of
vernacular education. Mass education was to be seen as
instructing masses through vernaculars.
1904 : Education policy put special emphasis on
vernacular education and increased grants for it.
1929 : Hartog Committee presented a gloomy picture
of primary education.
1937 : These schools received encouragement from
Congress ministries.

Development of Technical
Education
The Engineering College at Roorkee was set up in 1847; the
Calcutta College of Engineering came up in 1856. In 1858,
Overseers’ School at Poona was raised to the status of Poona
College of Engineering and affiliated to Bombay University.
Guindy College of Engineering was affiliated to Madras
University.
Medical training started with establishment of a medical
college in Calcutta in 1835. Lord Curzon did much to
broaden the whole basis of professional courses—medicine,
agriculture, engineering, veterinary sciences, etc. He
established an agriculture college at Pusa which acted as a
parent institution of similar institutions in other provinces.

Evaluation of British Policy
on Education
1. Even the inadequate measures the government took
for the expansion of modern education were guided by
concerns other than philanthropic. The government measures
for promotion of education were influenced by—
● agitation in favour of modern education by
enlightened Indians, Christian missionaries and
humanitarian officials;

Development of Education

 573

the need to ensure a cheap supply of educated
Indians to man an increasing number of subordinate
posts in administration and in British business
concerns—thus there was an emphasis on English
medium as the language of administration and of
education;
● the hope that educated Indians would help expand
market for British manufactures in India;
● an expectation that Western education would
reconcile Indians to British rule, particularly as it
glorified British conquerors and their administration.
The British thus wanted to use modern education to
strengthen the foundations of their political authority in India.
2. Traditional system of Indian learning gradually
declined for want of support, and specially after 1844 when
it was declared that applicants for government employment
should possess knowledge of English.
3. Mass education was neglected leading to widespread
illiteracy (1911—84 per cent and in 1921—92 per cent)
which created a wide linguistic and cultural gulf between the
educated few and the masses.
4. Since education was to be paid for, it became a
monopoly of upper and richer classes and city dwellers.
5. There was an almost total neglect of women’s
education because (i) the Government did not want to arouse
wrath of orthodox sections; and (ii) it had no immediate
utility for the colonial rule.
6. Scientific and technical education was by and large
neglected. By 1857 there were only three medical colleges
at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, and only one good
engineering college at Roorkee which was open only to
Europeans and Eurasians.

Peasant Movements
1857-1947
Peasantry Under Colonialism
The impoverishment of the Indian peasantry was a direct
result of the transformation of the agrarian structure due to—
● colonial economic policies,
● ruin of the handicrafts leading to overcrowding of
land,
● the new land revenue system,
● colonial administrative and judicial system.
The peasants suffered from high rents, illegal levies,
arbitrary evictions and unpaid labour in zamindari areas. In
Ryotwari areas, the government itself levied heavy land
revenue. The overburdened farmer, fearing loss of his only
source of livelihood, often approached the local moneylender
who made full use of the former’s difficulties by extracting
high rates of interests on the money lent. Often, the farmer
had to mortgage his land and cattle. Sometimes, the moneylender seized the mortgaged belongings. Gradually, over large
areas, the actual cultivators were reduced to the status of
tenants-at-will, share croppers and landless labourers.
The peasants often resisted the exploitation, and soon
they realised that their real enemy was the colonial state.
Sometimes, the desperate peasants took to crime to come
out of intolerable conditions. These crimes included robbery,
dacoity and what has been called social banditry.

A Survey of Early Peasant
Movements
Indigo Revolt (1859-60)

In Bengal, the indigo planters, nearly all Europeans, exploited
the local peasants by forcing them to grow indigo on their
lands instead of the more paying crops like rice. The planters
forced the peasants to take advance sums and enter into
fraudulent contracts which were then used against the peasants.
The planters intimidated the peasants through kidnappings,
illegal confinements, flogging, attacks on women and children,
seizure of cattle, burning and demolition of houses and
destruction of crops.
The anger of the peasants exploded in 1859 when, led
by Digambar Biswas and Bishnu Biswas of Nadia district, they
decided not to grow indigo under duress and resisted the
physical pressure of the planters and their lathiyals (retainers)
backed by police and the courts. They also organised a
counter force against the planters’ attacks. The planters also
tried methods like evictions and enhanced rents. The ryots
replied by going on a rent strike by refusing to pay the
enhanced rents and by physically resisting the attempts to
evict them. Gradually, they learned to use the legal machinery
and initiated legal action supported by fund collection.
The Bengali intelligentsia played a significant role by
supporting the peasants’ cause through newspaper campaigns,
organisation of mass meetings, preparing memoranda on
peasants’ grievances and supporting them in legal battles.
The Government appointed an indigo commission to
inquire into the problem of indigo cultivation. Based on its
recommendations, the Government issued a notification in
November 1860 that the ryots could not be compelled to
grow indigo and that it would ensure that all disputes were
settled by legal means. But, the planters were already closing
down factories and indigo cultivation was virtually wiped out
from Bengal by the end of 1860.

Pabna Agrarian Leagues

During the 1870s and 1880s, large parts of Eastern Bengal
witnessed agrarian unrest caused by oppressive practices of

576  

the zamindars. The zamindars resorted to enhanced rents
beyond legal limits and prevented the tenants from acquiring
occupancy rights under Act X of 1859. To achieve their ends,
the zamindars resorted to forcible evictions, seizure of cattle
and crops and prolonged, costly litigation in courts where
the poor peasant found himself at a disadvantage.
Having had enough of the oppressive regime, the
peasants of Yusufshahi Pargana in Patna district formed an
agrarian league or combination to resist the demands of the
zamindars. The league organised a rent strike—the ryots
refused to pay the enhanced rents, challenging the zamindars
in the courts. Funds were raised by ryots to fight the court
cases. The struggles spread throughout Patna and to other
districts of East Bengal. The main form of struggle was that
of legal resistance; there was very little violence.
Though the peasant discontent continued to linger on
till 1885, most of the cases had been solved, partially through
official persuasion and partially because of zamindars’ fears.
Many peasants were able to acquire occupancy rights and
resist enhanced rents. The government also promised to
undertake legislation to protect the tenants from the worst
aspects of zamindari oppression. In 1885, the Bengal Tenancy
Act was passed.
Again, a number of young Indian intellectuals supported
the peasants’ cause. These included Bankim Chandra Chatterjee,
R.C. Dutt and the Indian Association under Surendranath
Banerjea.

Deccan Riots

The ryots of Deccan region of western India suffered heavy
taxation under the Ryotwari system. Here again the peasants
found themselves trapped in a vicious network with the
moneylender as the exploiter and the main beneficiary. These
moneylenders were mostly outsiders—Marwaris or Gujaratis.
The conditions had worsened due to a crash in cotton prices
after the end of the American Civil War in 1864, the
Government’s decision to raise the land revenue by 50% in
1867, and a succession of bad harvests.
In 1874, the growing tension between the moneylenders
and the peasants resulted in a social boycott movement

Peasant Movements 1857-1947  577

organised by the ryots against the “outsider” moneylenders.
The ryots refused to buy from their shops. No peasant would
cultivate their fields. The barbers, washermen, shoemakers
would not serve them. This social boycott spread rapidly to
the villages of Poona, Ahmednagar, Sholapur and Satara. Soon
the social boycott was transformed into agrarian riots with
systematic attacks on the moneylenders’ houses and shops.
The debt bonds and deeds were seized and publicly burnt.
The Government succeeded in repressing the movement.
As a conciliatory measure, the Deccan Agriculturists Relief
Act was passed in 1879.
This time also, the modern nationalist intelligentsia of
Maharashtra supported the peasants’ cause.

Changed Nature of Peasant
Movements after 1857
● Peasants emerged as the main force in agrarian
movements, fighting directly for their own demands.
● The demands were centred almost wholly on
economic issues.
● The movements were directed against the immediate
enemies of the peasant—foreign planters and indigenous
zamindars and moneylenders.
● The struggles were directed towards specific and
limited objectives and redressal of particular grievances.
● Colonialism was not the target of these movements.
● It was not the objective of these movements to end
the system of subordination or exploitation of the peasants.
● Territorial reach was limited.
● There was no continuity of struggle or long-term
organisation.
● The peasants developed a strong awareness of their
legal rights and asserted them in and outside the courts.

Weaknesses

● There was a lack of an adequate understanding of
colonialism.
● The 19th-century peasants did not possess a new
ideology and a new social, economic and political programme.
● These struggles, however militant, occurred within the

578  

framework of the old societal order lacking a positive
conception of an alternative society.

Later Movements
The peasant movements of the 20th century were deeply
influenced by and had a marked impact on the national
freedom struggle. (Refer to the chapters on Freedom
Movement for ‘Champaran’ and ‘Kheda Satyagraha’.)

The Kisan Sabha Movement

After the 1857 revolt, the Awadh taluqdars had got back their
lands. This strengthened the hold of the taluqdars or big
landlords over the agrarian society of the province. The
majority of the cultivators were subjected to high rents,
summary evictions (bedakhali), illegal levies, renewal fees
or nazrana. The First World War had hiked the prices of
food and other necessities. This worsened the conditions of
the UP peasants.
Mainly due to the efforts of the Home Rule activists,
kisan sabhas were organised in UP. The United Provinces
Kisan Sabha was set up in February 1918 by Gauri Shankar
Mishra and Indra Narayan Dwivedi. Madan Mohan Malaviya
supported their efforts. By June 1919, the UP Kisan Sabha
had 450 branches. Other prominent leaders included Jhinguri
Singh, Durgapal Singh and Baba Ramchandra. In June 1920,
Baba Ramchandra urged Nehru to visit these villages. During
these visits, Nehru developed close contacts with the villagers.
In October 1920, the Awadh Kisan Sabha came into
existence because of differences in nationalist ranks. The
Awadh Kisan Sabha asked the kisans to refuse to till
bedakhali land, not to offer hari and begar (forms of unpaid
labour), to boycott those who did not accept these conditions
and to solve their disputes through panchayats.
From the earlier forms of mass meetings and
mobilisation, the patterns of activity changed rapidly in
January 1921 to the looting of bazaars, houses, granaries and
clashes with the police. The centres of activity were primarily
the districts of Rai Bareilly, Faizabad and Sultanpur.
The movement declined soon, partly due to government
repression and partly because of the passing of the Awadh
Rent (Amendment) Act.

Peasant Movements 1857-1947  579

Eka Movement

Towards the end of 1921, peasant discontent resurfaced in
some northern districts of the United Provinces—Hardoi,
Bahraich, Sitapur. The issues involved were:
(i) high rents—50 per cent higher than the recorded
rates;
(ii) oppression of thikadars in charge of revenue
collection; and
(iii) practice of share-rents.
The meetings of the Eka or the Unity Movement
involved a symbolic religious ritual in which the assembled
peasants vowed that they would
● pay only the recorded rent but would pay it on time;
● not leave when evicted;
● refuse to do forced labour;
● give no help to criminals;
● abide by panchayat decisions.
The grassroot leadership of the Eka Movement came
from Madari Pasi and other low-caste leaders, and many
small zamindars.
By March 1922, severe repression by authorities
brought the movement to an end.

Mappila Revolt

The Mappilas were the Muslim tenants inhabiting the Malabar
region where most of the landlords were Hindus. The
Mappilas had expressed their resentment against the
oppression of the landlords during the nineteenth century
also. Their grievances centred around lack of security of
tenure, high rents, renewal fees and other oppressive exactions.
The Mappila tenants were particularly encouraged by
the demand of the local Congress body for a government
legislation regulating tenant-landlord relations. Soon, the
Mappila movement merged with the ongoing Khilafat agitation.
The leaders of the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation Movement like
Gandhi, Shaukat Ali and Maulana Azad addressed Mappila
meetings. After the arrest of national leaders, the leadership
passed into the hands of local Mappila leaders.
Things took a turn for the worse in August 1921 when
the arrest of a respected priest leader, Ali Musaliar, sparked
off large-scale riots. Initially, the symbols of British

580  

authority—courts, police stations, treasuries and offices—
and unpopular landlords (jenmies who were mostly Hindus)
were the targets. But once the British declared martial law
and repression began in earnest, the character of the rebellion
underwent a definite change. Many Hindus were seen by the
Mappilas to be helping the authorities. What began as an antigovernment and anti-landlord affair acquired communal
overtones. The communalisation of the rebellion completed
the isolation of the Mappilas from the Khilafat-NonCooperation Movement. By December 1921, all resistance
had come to a stop.

Bardoli Satyagraha

The Bardoli taluqa in Surat district had witnessed intense
politicisation after the coming of Gandhi on the national
political scene. The movement sparked off in January 1926
when the authorities decided to increase the land revenue by
30 per cent. The Congress leaders were quick to protest and
a Bardoli Inquiry Committee was set up to go into the issue.
The committee found the revenue hike to be unjustified. In
February 1926, Vallabhbhai Patel was called to lead the
movement. The women of Bardoli gave him the title of
“Sardar”. Under Patel, the Bardoli peasants resolved to refuse
payments of the revised assessment until the Government
appointed an independent tribunal or accepted the current
amount as full payment. To organise the movement, Patel set
up 13 chhavanis or workers’ camps in the taluqa. Bardoli
Satyagraha Patrika was brought out to mobilise public
opinion. An intelligence wing was set up to make sure all
the tenants followed the movement’s resolutions. Those who
opposed the movement faced a social boycott. Special
emphasis was placed on the mobilisation of women. K.M.
Munshi and Lalji Naranji resigned from the Bombay Legislative
Council in support of the movement.
By August 1928, massive tension had built up in the
area. There were prospects of a railway strike in Bombay.
Gandhi reached Bardoli to stand by in case of any emergency.
The Government was looking for a graceful withdrawal now.
It set the condition that first the enhanced rent be paid by
all the occupants (not actually done). Then, a committee went
into the whole affair and found the revenue hike to be
unjustified and recommended a rise of 6.03 per cent only.

Peasant Movements 1857-1947  581

During the 1930s, the peasant awakening was influenced
by the Great Depression in the industrialised countries and
the Civil Disobedience Movement which took the form of
no-rent, no-revenue movement in many areas. Also, after the
decline of the active phase movement (1932) many new
entrants to active politics started looking for suitable outlets
for release of their energies and took to organisation of
peasants.

The All India Kisan Congress/Sabha
This sabha was founded in Lucknow in April 1936 with Swami
Sahjanand Saraswati as the president and N.G. Ranga as the
general secretary. A kisan manifesto was issued and a
periodical under Indulal Yagnik started. The AIKS and the
Congress held their sessions in Faizpur in 1936. The
Congress manifesto (especially the agrarian policy) for the
1937 provincial elections was strongly influenced by the
AIKS agenda.

Under Congress Ministries

The period 1937-39 was the high watermark of the peasant
movements and activity under the Congress provincial rule.
The chief form of mobilisation was through holding kisan
conferences and meetings where demands were aired and
resolutions were passed. Mobilisation campaigns were carried
out in the villages.

Peasant Activity in Provinces
Kerala
In the Malabar region, the peasants were mobilised mainly
by the Congress Socialist Party activists. Many “Karshak
Sanghams” (peasants’ organisations) came into existence. The
most popular method was the marching of jaths or peasants
groups to the landlords to get their demands accepted. One
significant campaign by the peasants was in 1938 for the
amendment of the Malabar Tenancy Act, 1929.
Andhra
This region had already witnessed a decline in the prestige
of zamindars after their defeat by Congressmen in elections.
Anti-zamindar movements were going on in some places.

582  

Many provincial ryot associations were active. N.G. Ranga
had set up, in 1933, the India Peasants’ Institute. After 1936,
the Congress socialists started organising the peasants. At
many places, the summer schools of economics and politics
were held and addressed by leaders like P.C. Joshi, Ajoy
Ghosh and R.D. Bhardwaj.
Bihar
Here, Sahjanand Saraswati was joined by Karyanand Sharma,
Yadunandan Sharma, Rahul Sankritayan, Panchanan Sharma,
Jamun Karjiti, etc. In 1935, the Provincial Kisan Conference
adopted the anti-zamindari slogan. The Provincial Kisan Sabha
developed a rift with the Congress over the ‘bakasht land’
issue because of an unfavourable government resolution
which was not acceptable to the sabha. The movement died
out by August 1939.
Punjab
The earlier peasant mobilisation here had been organised by
the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, the Kirti Kisan Party, the
Congress and the Akalis. A new direction to the movement
was given by the Punjab Kisan Committee in 1937. The main
targets of the movement were the landlords of western Punjab
who dominated the unionist ministry. The immediate issues
taken up were resettlement of land revenue in Amritsar and
Lahore and increase in water rates in canal colonies of
Multan and Montgomery where feudal levies were being
demanded by the private contractors. Here the peasants went
on a strike and were finally able to win concessions.
The peasant activity in Punjab was mainly concentrated
in Jullundur, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Lyallpur and Shekhupura.
The Muslim tenants-at-will of west Punjab and the Hindu
peasants of south-eastern Punjab (today’s Haryana) remained
largely unaffected.
Peasant activity was also organised in Bengal (Burdwan
and 24 Parganas), Assam (Surma Valley), Orissa, Central
Provinces and NWFP.

During the War

Because of a pro-War line adopted by the communists, the
AIKS was split on communist and non-communist lines and
many veteran leaders like Sahjanand, Indulal Yagnik and N.G.

Peasant Movements 1857-1947  583

Ranga left the sabha. But the Kisan Sabha continued to work
among the people. It did notable work during the famine of
1943.

Post-War Phase
Tebhaga Movement
In September 1946, the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha gave
a call to implement, through mass struggle, the Flood
Commission recommendations of tebhaga—two-thirds’
share—to the bargardars, the share-croppers also known as
bagchasi or adhyar, instead of the one-half share. The
bargardars worked on lands rented from the jotedars. The
communist cadres, including many urban student militias
went to the countryside to organise the bargardars. The
central slogan was “nij khamare dhan tolo”—i.e.,
sharecroppers taking the paddy to their own threshing floor
and not to the jotedar’s house, as before, so as to enforce
tebhaga.
The storm centre of the movement was north Bengal,
principally among Rajbanshis—a low caste of tribal origin.
Muslims also participated in large numbers. The movement
dissipated soon, because of the League ministry’s sop of the
Bargardari Bill, an intensified repression, the popularisation
of the Hindu Mahasabha’s agitation for a separate Bengal and
renewed riots in Calcutta which ended the prospects of
sympathetic support from the urban sections.
Telangana Movement
This was the biggest peasant guerrilla war of modern Indian
history affecting 3000 villages and 3 million population. The
princely state of Hyderabad under Asajahi Nizams was
marked by a combination of religious-linguistic domination
(by a mall Urdu-speaking Muslim elite ruling over
predominantly Hindu-Telugu, Marathi, Kannada-speaking
groups), total lack of political and civil liberties, grossest
forms of forced exploitation by deshmukhs, jagirdars,
doras (landlords) in forms of forced labour (vethi) and
illegal exactions.
During the war, the communist-led guerrillas had built
a strong base in Telangana villages through Andhra Mahasabha
and had been leading local struggles on issues such as

584  

wartime exactions, abuse of rationing, excessive rent and
vethi.
The uprising began in July 1946 when a deshmukh’s
thug murdered a village militant in Jangaon taluq of Nalgonda.
Soon, the uprising spread to Warrangal and Khammam.
The peasants organised themselves into village
sanghams, and attacked using lathis, stone slings and chilli
powder. They had to face brutal repression. The movement
was at its greatest intensity between August 1947 and
September 1948. The peasants brought about a rout of the
Razaqars—the Nizam’s stormtroopers. Once the Indian
security forces took over Hyderabad, the movement fizzled
out.
The Telangana movement had many positive achievement
to its credit.
● In the villages controlled by guerrillas, vethi and
forced labour disappeared.
● Agricultural wages were raised.
● Illegally seized lands were restored.
● Steps were taken to fix ceilings and redistribute lands.
● Measures were taken to improve irrigation and fight
cholera.
● An improvement in the condition of women was
witnessed.
● The autocratic-feudal regime of India’s biggest princely
state was shaken up, clearing the way for the formation of
Andhra Pradesh on linguistic lines and realising another aim
of the national movement in this region.

Balance-Sheet of Peasant
Movements
These movements created an atmosphere for postindependence agrarian reforms, for instance, abolition of
zamindari.
They eroded the power of the landed class, thus adding
to the transformation of the agrarian structure.
These movements were based on the ideology of
nationalism.
The nature of these movements was similar in diverse
areas.

The Movement of the Working Class

 585

Chapter 32

The Movement of the
Working Class
The beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century
heralded the entry of modern industry into India. The
thousands of hands employed in construction of railways
were harbingers of the modern Indian working class. Further
industrialisation came with the development of ancillary
industries along with the railways. The coal industry developed
fast and employed a large working force. Then came the
cotton and the jute industries.
The Indian working class suffered from the same kind
of exploitation witnessed during the industrialisation of
Europe and the rest of the West, such as low wages, long
working hours, unhygienic and hazardous working conditions,
employment of child labour and the absence of basic
amenities. The presence of colonialism in India gave a
distinctive touch to the Indian working class movement. The
Indian working class had to face two basic antagonistic
forces—an imperialist political rule and economic exploitation
at the hands of both foreign and native capitalist classes.
Under the circumstances, inevitably, the Indian working class
movement became intertwined with the political struggle for
national emancipation.

Early Efforts
The early nationalists, especially the Moderates,
● were indifferent to the labour’s cause;
585

586  

differentiated between the labour in the Indianowned factories and those in the British-owned
factories;
● believed that labour legislations would affect the
competitive edge enjoyed by the Indian-owned
industries;
● did not want a division in the movement on the basis
of classes;
● did not support the Factory Acts of 1881 and 1891
for these reasons.
Thus, earlier attempts to improve the economic
conditions of the workers were in the nature of the
philanthropic efforts which were isolated, sporadic and aimed
at specific local grievances.
1870 Sasipada Banerjea started a workingmen’s club
and newspaper Bharat Shramjeevi.
1878 Sorabjee Shapoorji Bengalee tried to get a bill,
providing better working conditions to labour, passed in the
Bombay Legislative Council.
1880 Narain Meghajee Lokhanday started the newspaper
Deenbandhu and set up the Bombay Mill and Millhands
Association.
1899 The first strike by the Great Indian Peninsular
Railways took place, and it got widespread support. Tilak’s
Kesari and Maharatta had been campaigning for the strike
for months.
There were many prominent nationalist leaders like
Bipin Chandra Pal and G. Subramanya Aiyar who demanded
better conditions for workers and other pro-labour reforms.
●

During Swadeshi Upsurge
Workers participated in wider political issues. Strikes were
organised by Ashwini Coomar Banerjea, Prabhat Kumar Roy
Chaudhuri, Premtosh Bose and Apurba Kumar Ghosh. These
strikes were organised in government press, railways and the
jute industry.
There were attempts to form trade unions but these
were not very successful.
Subramaniya Siva and Chidambaram Pillai led strikes
in Tuticorin and Tirunelvelli and were arrested.

The Movement of the Working Class

 587

The biggest strike of the period was organised after
Tilak’s arrest and trial.

During the First World War
and After
The War and its aftermath brought a rise in exports, soaring
prices, massive profiteering opportunities for the industrialists
but very low wages for the workers. This led to discontent
among workers.
The emergence of Gandhi led to a broad-based national
movement and the emphasis was placed on the mobilisation
of the workers and peasants for the national cause.
A need was felt for the organisation of the workers
in trade unions.
International events like the establishment of a socialist
republic in the Soviet Union, formation of the Comintern and
setting up of International Labour Organisation (ILO) lent a
new dimension to the movement of the working class in India.

The AITUC

The All India Trade Union Congress was founded on October
31, 1920. The Indian National Congress president for the
year, Lala Lajpat Rai, was elected as the first president of
AITUC and Dewan Chaman Lal as the first general secretary.
Lajpat Rai was the first to link capitalism with imperialism—
“imperialism and militarism are the twin children of
capitalism”.
The prominent Congress and swarajist leader C.R. Das
presided over the third and the fourth sessions of the AITUC.
The Gaya session of the Congress (1922) welcomed the
formation of the AITUC and a committee was formed to
assist it. C.R. Das advocated that the Congress should take
up the workers’ and peasants’ cause and incorporate them in
the struggle for swaraj or else they would get isolated from
the movement. Other leaders who kept close contacts with
the AITUC included Nehru, Subhas Bose, C.F. Andrews, J.M.
Sengupta, Satyamurthy, V.V. Giri and Sarojini Naidu. In the
beginning, the AITUC was influenced by social democratic
ideas of the British Labour Party. The Gandhian philosophy
of non-violence, trusteeship and class-collaboration had great

588  

influence on the movement. Gandhi helped organise the
Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association (1918) and through
a protest secured a 27.5 per cent wage hike. (Later, the
arbitrator’s award ensured a 35 per cent raise.)

The Trade Union Act, 1926

The Trade Union Act, 1926
● recognised trade unions as legal associations;
● laid down conditions for registration and regulation
of trade union activities;
● secured immunity, both civil and criminal, for trade
unions from prosecution for legitimate activities, but
put some restrictions on their political activities.

Late 1920s

A strong communist influence on the movement lent a
militant and revolutionary content to it. In 1928 there was
a six-month-long strike in Bombay Textile Mills led by the
Girni Kamgar Union. The whole of 1928 witnessed
unprecedented industrial unrest. This period also saw the
crystallisation of various communist groups, with leaders like
S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, P.C. Joshi, Sohan Singh Joshi
etc.
Alarmed at the increasing strength of the trade union
movement under extremist influence, the government resorted
to legislative restrictions. It passed the Public Safety Ordinance
(1929) and the Trade Disputes Act (TDA), 1929. The TDA,
1929
● made compulsory the appointment of Courts of
Inquiry and Consultation Boards for settling industrial
disputes;
● made illegal the strikes in public utility services like
posts, railways, water and electricity, unless each
individual worker planning to go on strike gave an
advance notice of one month to the administration;
● forbade trade union activity of coercive or purely
political nature and even sympathetic strikes.

Meerut Conspiracy Case (1929)

In March 1929, the Government arrested 31 labour leaders,
and the three-and-a-half-year trial resulted in the conviction
of Muzaffar Ahmed, S.A. Dange, Joglekar, Philip Spratt, Ben

The Movement of the Working Class

 589

Bradley, Shaukat Usmani and others. The trial got worldwide
publicity but weakened the working class movement.
The workers participated during 1930 in the Civil
Disobedience Movement but after 1931 there was a dip in
the working class movement because of a split in 1931 in
which the corporatist trend led by N.M. Joshi broke away
from the AITUC to set up the All India Trade Union
Federation. In 1935, the communists rejoined the AITUC.
Now, the left front consisted of the communists, Congress
socialists and the leftist nationalists like Nehru and Subhas.

Under Congress Ministries

During the 1937 elections, the AITUC had supported the
Congress candidates. The Congress governments in provinces
gave a fillip to the trade union activity. The Congress
ministries were generally sympathetic to the workers’ demands.
Many legislations favourable to the workers were passed.

During and After the
Second World War
Initially, the workers opposed the War but after 1941 when
Russia joined the war on behalf of the Allies, the communists
described the war as a “peoples’ war” and supported it. The
communists dissociated themselves from the Quit India
Movement. A policy of industrial peace was advocated by
the communists.
In the period 1945 to 1947, workers participated
actively in the post-War national upsurges. In 1945, the dock
workers of Bombay and Calcutta refused to load ships taking
supplies to the warring troops in Indonesia. During 1946, the
workers went on a strike in support of the Naval Ratings.
During the last year of foreign rule, there were strikes by
workers of posts, railways and many other establishments.

After Independence
The working class movement got polarised on the basis of
political ideologies.

Challenges Before the
New-born Nation
First Day of Independent
India
August 15, 1947 started an epoch that ended India’s colonial
subjugation and looked forward to a new India—India as an
independent country. The Constituent Assembly of India met
at 11 p.m. on August 14, 1947. Rajendra Prasad presided over
the session. In a ceremony held in the Constituent Assembly
(in Parliament House) at midnight of August 14-15, 1947,

Jawaharlal Nehru, speaking as the first prime minister of
Independent India, gave his historic speech. Nehru said, “Long
years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time
comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in
full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of midnight
hour, when the world sleeps, India will wake to life and
freedom...”
On August 15, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, as Prime
Minister of India, hoisted the Indian national flag above the
Lahori Gate of Red Fort in Delhi.

First Government After Independence

The governor-general and the ministers were sworn in.
Jawaharlal Nehru took charge as the first Prime Minister of
India on August 15, 1947, and was assisted by 15 other
members. Sardar Patel served as the deputy prime minister
till his death in December 1950. Lord Mountbatten, and later
C. Rajagopalachari served as Governor-General till January
26, 1950, when India became a republic and elected Rajendra
Prasad as its first president.
The first Council of Ministers of Independent India was
as follows.
1. Jawaharlal Nehru: Prime Minister; Minister of
External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations; Minister
of Scientific Research
2. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel: Deputy Prime Minister;
Minister of Home Affairs and States; Minister of
Information and Broadcasting
3. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad: Minister of Education
4. John Mathai: Minister of Railways and Transport
5. Sardar Baldev Singh: Minister of Defence
6. Jairamdas Daulatram: Minister of Food and
Agriculture
7. Jagjivan Ram: Minister of Labour
8. C.H. Bhabha: Minister of Commerce
9. Amrit Kaur: Minister of Health
10. Rafi Ahmad Kidwai: Minister of Communications
11. Narhar Vishnu Gadgil: Minister of Works, Mines
and Power
12. R.K. Shanmukham Chetty: Minister of Finance

592  

13. K.C. Neogy: Minister of Relief and Rehabilitation
14. B.R. Ambedkar: Minister of Law (belonged to the
Scheduled Castes Federation; resigned in 1951)
15. Shyama Prasad Mookherjee: Minister of Industries
and Supplies [Hindu Mahasabha; first to resign from
the cabinet in April 1950]
16. Narasimha Gopalaswami Ayyangar: Minister without
portfolio; assigned the task to act as a link between
the union government and the cabinet of East Punjab
government
17. Mohanlal Saxena: Minister without portfolio

Challenges

Independent India, however, had to face several challenges.
Immediate Challenges—territorial and administrative
integration of princely states, communal riots, rehabilitation
of nearly 60 lakh refugees migrated from Pakistan, protection
of Muslims living in India as well as those going to Pakistan
from communal gangs, need to avoid war with Pakistan,
Communist insurgency, etc.
Medium Term Challenges—framing of the
Constitution for India, building of a representative, democratic
and civil libertarian political order, elections, and abolition
of feudal set up in agriculture, etc.
Long Term Challenges—national integration,
economic development, poverty alleviation, etc.
India, as well as Pakistan, faced the consequences of
partition. The Independence Act had laid the procedure for
the resolution of three major problems—(i) the settlement
of boundaries between the two nations; (ii) the division of
apparatus and personnel of Indian Civil Services and some
other services; and (iii) division of military assets and
formations.

Radcliffe’s Boundary Award and
the Communal Riots
In accordance with the partition plan, the respective legislative
assemblies of Punjab and Bengal met in two sections (one
representing the Muslim majority districts and other of the

Challenges Before the New-born Nation

 593

rest of the province) and decided by simple majority in favour
of the partition of the two provinces. West Punjab which went
to Pakistan received 62,000 square miles of territory and
15.7 million people (census 1941), of whom 11.85 million
were Muslims. East Punjab (India’s share) received 37,000
square miles of land area, with a population of 12.6 million,
of whom 4.37 million were Muslims. Likewise, West Bengal
became part of India with a territory of 28,000 square miles,
and a population of 21.2 million, of whom 5.3 million were
Muslims. East Bengal, which constituted East Pakistan, got
49,400 square miles of territory and 39.10 million people
(27.7 million Muslims and the rest non-Muslims). Thus on
both sides of the Radcliffe Line, sizable sections of populations
became minority (religion-wise)—20 million non-Muslims
in Pakistan and 42 million (later reduced to 35 million)
Muslims in India.

Challenges before the Boundary
Commission

In absurd hurry, the British government appointed the Boundary
Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Cyril Radcliffe.
The Boundary Commission consisted of two Muslims and
two non-Muslim judges in each case, and worked under
serious constraints. Radcliffe, with very limited knowledge
of India, and with the use of out-of-date maps and census
materials, was required to draw the boundaries and decide
disputed points within a period of six weeks.
Although the religious demography was the deciding
factor, other factors, such as rivers as natural boundaries,
administrative units, economic viability, railway and roadway
connectivity and other infrastructural facilities, such as the
canal system, were also to be taken into consideration. The
Sikhs, as a third party (Hindus and Muslims being two
parties), were demographically scattered throughout Punjab.
Their demand that all Sikh holy shrines be included in East
Punjab (part of India) further complicated the situation. In
face of such legal intricacies, a rational approach gave way
to political considerations. The census of 1941, the basis of
decisions, was also faulty. So the resultant boundary lines
were bound to create several problems and leave many people
unhappy.

594  

The report of the Boundary Commission was ready by
August 12, but Lord Mountbatten intentionally made it
public after August 15, so that the responsibility of the
consequences—communal riots and its repercussions—would
not fall on the British.
The way in which the British government decided to
demarcate the boundary and leave the country amidst unrest
was a most callous way to behave.

Regions Most Affected by Riots

The communal riots had started in August 1946 itself, but
with the announcement of partition and independence, the
situation became more inflamed. The regions through which
the Radcliffe line was drawn became most violent and
maximum number of murders, rapes and abduction of women
and children took place. Armed bands of Sikhs (and Hindus)
and Muslims roamed the cities and countryside of Punjab,
committing unbelievable crimes.
A war of extermination was launched on both sides of
the border, when refugee trains are reported to have arrived
sometimes carrying only dead bodies. According to an
estimate, around 180,000 were killed (60,000 from the west
and 120,000 from the east).
The regions of Bengal, due to the presence of Gandhi
and his efforts through fasts, experienced less violence in
comparison to Punjab.
Riots began in Delhi, with a massacre of Muslims in
revenge for Punjab (Gandhian fasts had a temporary impact).
In Bihar, prior to partition, in October 1946, Hindu
peasants, allegedly instigated by Hindu landlords to divert
attention from agrarian problems, killed Muslims. This was
followed by violence in Garhmukteswar in the United Province
where Hindu pilgrims killed thousand Muslims. But after
partition, due to Gandhi’s initiatives, no massacres took place
in these regions.
Why so many casualties The governor-general
anticipated the danger of riots and assembled a boundary
force of 50,000 men. But Nehru’s decision to not allow
British troops into the matter proved devastating—the boundary
force themselves got divided along communal affiliations.
Further, the European officers were busy preparing to leave
India. According to Lockhart, the Commander-in-Chief of the

Challenges Before the New-born Nation

 595

Views
The systematic failure of British governments to contemplate or
prepare for any planned transfer of power to India is epitomised
by the fact that a man of Radcliffe’s background and lack of
experience (he had never been east of Gibraltar before he came
to India) should have been asked to embark on such a
fundamental task so very late in the day.
—Walter Reid, Keeping the Jewel in the Crown
With limitations of time, knowledge and understanding, it was
virtually impossible to deal adequately with the often vital
accessories of a boundary line—such as the location of the canal
head waters in relation to the canals themselves, communications
by road and rail, the fate of mixed or isolated populations and
such ‘invisible’ problems as the location of pasture lands in
relation to villagers’ flocks and herds.
—Percival Spear
He (Radcliffe) tried to take account of irrigation canals and water
supplies so that there was enough water in the central Punjab,
but on the scale with which he was dealing, he was bound to
make mistakes. If villages weren’t bisected by the boundary they
were separated from the villagers’ fields, railway stations from
the towns they served and communities from the resources on
which they relied.
Walter Reid, Keeping the Jewel in the Crown
They had absolutely no conception. They asked me to come
in and do this sticky job for them, and when I had done it they
hated it. But what could they expect in the circumstances?
Surely, they must have realised what was coming to them once
they had decided on partition. But they had made absolutely
no plans for coping with the situation.
—Radcliffe, quoted by Leonard Mosley,
The Last Days of the British Raj

Indian Army (August 15–December 31, 1947), the widespread
disorder would have been under control if all the personnel
from civil and armed services had been placed in their
respective new countries.

Challenges Associated with
Division of Resources
The partition of India was accompanied by division of
resources of the civil government as well as division of the
military forces and equipment.

596  

Division of Civil Government

To resolve the division of civil government amicably, a
partition council, presided over by the governor-general and
consisting of two representatives each of India and Pakistan,
was set up. The council was helped by a steering committee,
consisting of H.M. Patel and Mohammad Ali, at operational
level. All civl servants were offered to give their option about
the Dominion they wanted to serve. Around 1,60,000
employees opted for transfer from India to Pakistan or from
Pakistan to India.
For the personnel of the Indian Civil Services, a
distinction was made between the Europeans and the Indians.
The Indian members were to continue in service in their
country of choice (India or Pakistan) on the existing scale
of service. The European officers could continue in service
on their existing pay, leave, pension rights, etc., but if they
wished to retire they were entitled to special compensation
and early retirement.

Division of Finances

The division of cash balances as well as allocation of public
debt created tensions between the two countries. Pakistan
wanted a one-fourth share of the total cash balances, but India
had to point out that only a small portion of the cash balances
represented the real cash needs of the undivided India and
the rest was maintained only as an anti-inflationary mechanism.
Ramachandra Guha writes in his India After Gandhi that the
Indian government had withheld Pakistan’s share of the
‘sterling balance’ which the British owed jointly to the two
dominions, a debt incurred on account of Indian contributions
to the Second World War. The amount was some Rs 550
million. The Indian government was not keen to release the
money due to Pakistan as it was angry with Pakistan for
having attempted to seize Kashmir by force. Gandhi saw this
as being unnecessarily spiteful. He went on a fast and made
the ending of the fast conditional on the transfer of the
money owed to Pakistan. He succeeded in pressurising the
Congress leadership to decide to give more cash resources
to Pakistan. (According to some scholars, this became one
of the reasons for the assassination of Gandhi by a Hindu
fanatic).

Challenges Before the New-born Nation

 597

Division of Defence Personnel and
Equipment

For a smooth division of the armed forces and their plants,
machinery, equipment and stores, a joint defence council,
headed by Auchinleck as its Supreme Commander, was set
up. The council decided that Muslim-majority units should
be transferred to Pakistan and non-Muslim units to India, but
due to serious differences between the two parties, the post
of Supreme Commander was abolished. Amidst serious
chaos, the British troops started to leave India from August
17, 1947 and the process was completed by February 1948.

Assassination of Gandhi
On the evening of January 30, 1948, as he carried on his
usual prayer meeting at Birla mansion (New Delhi), Mahatma
Gandhi was shot dead by Nathuram Godse. The event sent
shock waves through the nation in making. Communalism and
misinterpretation of nationalism were two fundamental factors
under whose influence Godse killed Gandhi.
In an address to the nation on the All India Radio, Nehru
summed up the mood and spirit of the time, “The light has
gone out of our lives and there is darkness everywhere…
The best prayer we can offer him and his memory is to
dedicate ourselves to truth and to the cause for which the
great countryman of ours lived and for which he died.”
Sardar Patel appealed to the people not to seek revenge
but to follow Gandhi’s message of love and non-violence.
He said, “It is a shame for us that the greatest man of the
world has had to pay with his life for the sins which we have
committed. We did not follow him when he was alive; let
us at least follow his steps now he is dead.”
Nathuram Godse was tried and sentenced to death. At
his trial he declared that he had acted as he had because of
Gandhi’s consistent pandering to the Muslims, “culminating
in his last pro-Muslim fast [which] at last goaded me to the
conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought
to an end immediately.”
On February 4, 1948, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
(RSS) was banned by the government. It was felt by the

598  

government that the right wing extremism which the RSS was
seen to represent would be very harmful for the unity of the
nation. Though not directly involved in the assassination of
Gandhi, the organisation was seen to have a hand in the Punjab
violence. It also attracted the support of many of the
refugees. It was also rumoured that the members of the RSS
had celebrated the death of Gandhi. Nehru considered that
groups such as the RSS had “the blood of Mahatma Gandhi
on their hands” even though they dissociated themselves from
his killing. The ban was lifted in July 1949, when the RSS
accepted the conditions laid down by the government. These
conditions were that the Sangh would restrict itself to cultural
activities and not meddle with politics; renounce its agenda
of violence and secrecy; profess publicly loyalty to the Indian
Constitution and flag (tri-colour); and organise itself on
democratic principles.

Rehabilitation and Resettlement
of Refugees
The people displaced by partition were ‘refugees’ in the sense
that they had not left their homes voluntarily. The two new
governments did not organise an orderly exchange of
population. Refugee resettlement became the immediate
challenge for both governments (India and Pakistan). The
Indian government established an emergency committee of
the cabinet to deal with the crisis in Delhi, and a Ministry
of Relief and Rehabilitation to look after the refugees. In
view of large-scale influx of displaced people, the notion of
‘evacuee property’ to be protected by government, for any
future return of those who had left for Pakistan, became an
empty rhetoric because it was almost impossible to force
the refugees who settled in the empty houses of Muslims.
(This, at a later time, made the return of the refugees
impossible).

East Punjab

Some refugees were accommodated temporarily in refugee
camps, which were run till 1949. For urban refugees, the
government started industrial and vocational training schemes,

Challenges Before the New-born Nation

 599

and even grants were given to start small businesses or
industries. The rural refugees were given land, agricultural
loans and housing subsidies. Although, the state government
and the central government mobilised massive resources, it
was still not adequate and a general trend of differentiated
entitlements to such benefits was observed. For example
refugees with social and cultural capital—class and caste
status and political connections—often got the better deal,
while the depressed classes were given little or no
consideration.

Bengal

The problem was much more prolonged and complicated in
Bengal. By 1948, only a small group of high-caste, landed
or middle class Hindus migrated to West Bengal by arranging
exchange of property or jobs on individual levels. But during
December 1949 and January 1950, due to a fresh outbreak
of violence in Khulna, a large number of peasants started to
leave East Pakistan. In revenge, anti-Muslim riots started in
February 1950 and forced about one million Muslims to
leave West Bengal. This further aggravated anti-Hindu violence
in East Pakistan and by 1951, about 15 lakh Hindu refugees
arrived in West Bengal. But the Indian government didn’t
recognise these migrants as refugees and Nehru tried to send
them back.

Delhi Pact on Minorities

To resolve the problems of refugees and restore communal
peace in the two countries, especially in Bengal (East
Pakistan as well as West Bengal), the Indian prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pakistani prime minister, Liaquat
Ali Khan, signed an agreement on April 8, 1950. The
agreement, known as the Delhi Pact on Minorities or LiaquatNehru Pact, envisaged the appointment of ministers from
minority communities in both Pakistan and India at both
central and provincial levels. Under the pact, minority
commissions were to be set up, together with the Commissions
of Inquiry to look into the probable causes behind the
communal riots on both sides of border (in Bengal), and to
recommend steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents.
Under the pact, India and Pakistan also agreed to include

600  

representatives of the minority community in the cabinets
of East Pakistan and West Bengal and decided to depute two
central ministers, one from each government, to remain in
the affected regions for such period as might be necessary.
The pact provided for the creation of an agency
entrusted with the task of recovering and rehabilitating
‘abducted’ women (the idea was criticised by many scholars).
The idea to encourage refugees to return to their original
homes failed, because the two governments failed to restore
confidence among the refugees. Further, the properties of
the refugees were declared as enemy property [India brought
amendments in the Enemy Property Act, 1968 in 2016 also].
The provisions of the Liaquat-Nehru Pact were severely
criticised by Hindu nationalists like Shyama Prasad
Mookherjee and K.C. Neogy. Mookherjee resigned from the
Nehru cabinet in protest, as he believed that the refugee
problem could only be solved through a transfer of population
and acquisition of certain territories from Pakistan to
rehabilitate the people who came into India.

Centres of Refugee Settlements in India

In Delhi, Lajpat Nagar, Rajinder Nagar, Punjabi Bagh,
Nizamuddin East and Kingsway Camp were some areas
developed into housing complexes to settle the refugees
permanently. People who came from West Pakistan settled
in states like Punjab (which at the time included the present
day Haryana) and Himachal Pradesh. The Sindhi Hindus
settled in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.
Ulhasnagar (city of joy), in Maharashtra, was especially
developed to settle refugees from Sindh areas.
West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and other north-eastern
states accommodated the refugees from East Pakistan (present
Bangladesh). The government settled some refugees in the
Andaman Islands too (at present, Bengalis form the largest
linguistic group in some parts of Andaman Islands).

Communists and Independence
On September 1948, on the pretext of maintaining law and
order situation in South India, the Indian army intervened and
took control of Hyderabad without much resistance from the

Challenges Before the New-born Nation

 601

Nizam. But the internal politics of Hyderabad became
complicated due to the Telangana movement led by the
communists. The alliance between the Congress and the
communists had broken before the accession of Hyderabad
into India.
In December 1947, the Communist Party of India (CPI)
had denounced the Indian independence as ‘fake’—with the
slogan, ‘ye azadi jhooti hai’—and termed the Congress
government led by Nehru as the stooges of Anglo-American
imperialism and the feudal forces within the country. In
February-March 1948, in its Second Congress in Calcutta,
the CPI adopted its ‘Political Thesis’, which formally declared
that the national government established on August 15, 1947
was indeed the major enemy of the Indian people and hence
required to be changed through general revolution. To achieve
this goal, the communist leaders decided to follow what
popularly came to be known as the B.T. Ranadive line (after
the name of CPI’s then general secretary). They declared,
“the present state will be replaced by a people’s democratic
republic—a republic of workers, peasants and oppressed
middle classes.” The Communist insurgency spread to other
parts of India especially in West Bengal which saw the revival
of the Tebhaga Movement and an urban insurgency in
Calcutta.

Why Communists were Sceptical about
Independence?

1. They believed that a policy of class struggle and
armed insurgency against the State run by the Congress,
alleged as collaborationist bourgeoisie, was necessary to
shift the attention of the masses from the politics of
communal hatred that shrouded the country after partition.
2. The late 1940s and the early 1950s witnessed
communist successes in Asian countries like China, Malaya,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Burma (Myanmar). In September
1947, Russia announced its ‘A. Zhdanov thesis’ as an answer
to the Marshall Plan, encouraging more activism on the part
of the international communist parties. The Indian communists
thus geared up for an armed insurgency.

602  

3. According to Ramachandra Guha, the CPI leadership,
encouraged by the initial successes of the Telangana
movement, misconceived the ‘scattered disillusionment with
the Congress as revolutionary potential, and thought this as
the ‘beginning of Red India’.

Shift from Antagonistic Strategy to
Constitutional Democracy

The communist movement remained localised in Hyderabad
and West Bengal. The mass support was sporadic and
conditional as people were not ready to reject the Congress
so soon after Independence. The government also decided to
take stern action; while in the Hyderabad region the Indian
armed forces continued its ‘police action’, in West Bengal
the CPI was banned in March 1948 and in January, a security
act was passed to imprison the communist leaders without
trial. Within the Communist leadership, there were divisions
on the ‘Chinese line’ and the ‘Russian line’ which became
wider after the failure of a proposed railway strike on May
9, 1949.
In September 1950, the prominent communist leaders
like Ajoy Ghosh, S.A. Dange and S.V. Ghate criticised the
organisation for its faulty strategies and its failure to take
notice of the true picture of independent India. Consequently,
in October 1951, at the Third Party Congress of the CPI,
held in Calcutta, a significant shift in its policy was endorsed.
It decided to withdraw the Telangana movement and forge
an inclusive front of the peasants, workers and middle
classes. Consequently, the ban was lifted by the government,
and the Indian communists participated in the general election
of 1951-52, thus moving from an insurrectionist path to the
path of constitutional democracy.

Chapter 34

The Indian States
The princely states, also called the Indian states, which
covered a total area of 7,12,508 square miles and numbered
no fewer than 562, included tiny states such as Bilbari with
a population of 27 persons only and some big ones like
Hyderabad (as large as Italy) with a population of 14 million.
The East India Company acquired, in the process of conquest,
important coastal tracts, the valleys of the great navigable
rivers and such tracts which were rich in agricultural
products and densely populated by prosperous people, while,
generally, the Indian states were “the inaccessible and less
fertile tracts of the Indian peninsula”.
The making of Indian states was largely governed by
the same circumstances which led to the growth of East India
Company’s power in India. The evolution of relations between
the British authority and states can be traced under the
following broad stages.

I. The Company’s Struggle for
Equality from a Position of
Subordination (1740-1765)
Starting with Anglo-French rivalry with the coming of
Dupleix in 1751, the East India Company asserted political
identity with capture of Arcot (1751). With the Battle of
Plassey in 1757, the East India Company acquired political
603

604  

power next only to the Bengal nawabs. In 1765 with the
acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, the
East India Company became a significant political power.

II. Policy of Ring Fence
(1765-1813)
This policy was reflected in Warren Hastings’ wars against
the Marathas and Mysore, and aimed at creating buffer zones
to defend the Company’s frontiers. The main threat was from
the Marathas and Afghan invaders (the Company undertook
to organise Awadh’s defence to safeguard Bengal’s security).
Wellesley’s policy of subsidiary alliance was an extension
of ring fence—which sought to reduce states to a position
of dependence on British Government in India. Major powers
such as Hyderabad, Awadh and the Marathas accepted
subsidiary alliance. Thus, British supremacy was established.

III. Policy of Subordinate
Isolation (1813-1857)
Now, the imperial idea grew and the theory of paramountcy
began to develop—Indian states were supposed to act in
subordinate cooperation with the British government and
acknowledge its supremacy. The states surrendered all forms
of external sovereignty but retained sovereignty in internal
administration. British Residents were transformed from
diplomatic agents of a foreign power to executive and
controlling officers of a superior government.
In 1833, the Charter Act ended the Company’s
commercial functions even as it retained political functions.
It adopted the practice of insisting on prior approval/sanction
for all matters of succession. In 1834, the Board of Directors
issued guidelines to annex states wherever and whenever
possible. This policy of annexation culminated in usurpation
of eight states by Dalhousie including some big states such
as Satara and Nagpur.

The Indian States

 605

IV. Policy of Subordinate Union
(1857-1935)
The year 1858 saw the assumption of direct responsibility
by the Crown. Because of the states’ loyalty during the 1857
revolt and their potential use as breakwaters in political
storms of the future, the policy of annexation was abandoned.
The new policy was to punish or depose but not to annex.
After 1858, the fiction of authority of the Mughal emperor
ended; sanction for all matters of succession was required
from the Crown since the Crown stood forth as the
unquestioned ruler and the paramount power. Now the ruler
inherited the gaddi not as a matter of right but as a gift from
the paramount power, because the fiction of Indian states
standing in a status of equality with the Crown as independent,
sovereign states ended with the Queen adopting the title of
“Kaiser-i-Hind” (Queen Empress of India). The paramount
supremacy of the Crown presupposed and implied the
subordination of states. The British government exercised the
right to interfere in the internal spheres of states—partly in
the interest of the princes, partly in the interest of people’s
welfare, partly to secure proper conditions for British
subjects and foreigners and partly in the interest of the whole
of India.
The British government was further helped in this
encroachment by modern developments in communication—
railways, roads, telegraph, canals, post offices, press and
public opinion. The Government of India exercised complete
and undisputed control in international affairs—it could
declare war, peace or neutrality for states. According to the
Butler Commission in 1927, “For the purpose of international
relations, state territory is in the same position as British
territory and state subjects in the same position as British
subjects.”

Curzon’s Approach

Curzon stretched the interpretation of old treaties to mean
that the princes, in their capacity as servants of people, were
supposed to work side-by-side with the governor-general in

606  

the scheme of Indian government. He adopted a policy of
patronage and ‘intrusive surveillance’. He thought the relations
between the states and government were neither feudal nor
federal, but a type not based on a treaty but consisting of
a series of relationships having grown under different historical
conditions that, in the course of time, gradually conformed
to a single line.
The new trend seemed to reduce all states to a single
type—uniformly dependent on the British government and
considered as an integral part of Indian political system.

Post-1905

A policy of cordial cooperation began to counter progressive
and revolutionary developments in face of large-scale political
unrests.
According to the recommendations of the Montford
Reforms (1921), a Chamber of Princes (Narendra Mandal)
was set up as a consultative and advisory body having no say
in the internal affairs of individual states and having no
powers to discuss matters concerning existing rights and
freedoms. For the purpose of the chamber the Indian states
were divided into three categories—
1. Directly represented—109
2. Represented through representatives—127
3. Recognised as feudal holdings or jagirs.
Butler Committee
The question of extent of sovereignty and paramountcy was
still undefined. The Butler Committee (1927) was set up to
examine the nature of relationship between the
princely states and government. It gave the following
recommendations—
1. Paramountcy must remain supreme and must fulfil
its obligations, adopting and defining itself according to the
shifting necessities of time and progressive development of
states.
2. States should not be handed over to an Indian
Government in British India, responsible to an Indian
legislature, without the consent of states.
Thus, “paramountcy” was left undefined and this
hydra-headed creature was left to feed on usage, Crown’s
prerogative and the princes’ implied consent.

The Indian States

 607

V. Policy of Equal Federation
(1935-1947): A Non-Starter
The Government of India Act, 1935 proposed a Federal
Assembly with 125 out of 375 seats for the princes and the
Council of States with 104 out of 160 seats for the princes,
under its scheme of an all-India federation, which was subject
to ratification by states representing more than half of the
population and entitled to more than half of the seats in the
Council of States.
This scheme never came into existence and after the
outbreak of World War II (September 1939) it was dropped
altogether.

VI. Integration and Merger
After World War II began and a position of non-cooperation
was adopted by the Congress, the British government tried
to break the deadlock through the Cripps Mission (1942),
Wavell Plan (1945), Cabinet Mission (1946) and Attlee’s
statement (February 1947).
Cripps held that the British government did not
contemplate transferring paramountcy of Crown to any other
party in India. The states tried various schemes to forge a
union of their own, envisaging themselves as sovereign in
status or as a third force in the Indian political scene. The
June 3rd Plan and Attlee’s statement made it clear that the
states were free to join either of the two dominions, and
Mountbatten refused to give a sovereign status to the states.
Sardar Patel, who was in charge of the states’ ministry
in the interim cabinet, helped by V.P. Menon, the secretary
in the ministry, appealed to the patriotic feeling of rulers
to join the Indian dominion in matters of defence,
communication and external affairs—the three areas which
had been part of the paramountcy of the Crown and over
which the states had anyway no control. By August 15, 1947,
136 states had joined the Indian Union but others remained
precariously outside.

608  

Plebiscite and Army Action

1. Junagarh The Muslim Nawab wanted to join Pakistan
but a Hindu majority population wanted to join the Indian
Union. In the face of repressive attitude of the nawab, there
was a plebiscite which decided in favour of India.
2. Hyderabad Hyderabad wanted a sovereign status. It
signed a Standstill Agreement with India in November 1947.
Indian troops withdrew and the Nizam’s police and
stormtroopers (Razakkars) took over. The Nizam wanted an
outlet to the sea (Goa). The violence and supply of foreign
arms prompted Indian troops to move in again in 1948—
described as “a police action to restore law and order”.
Hyderabad acceded in November 1949.
3. Kashmir The state of Jammu and Kashmir had a
Hindu prince and a Muslim majority population. The prince
envisaged a sovereign status for the state and was reluctant
to accede to either of the dominions. As he procrastinated,
the newly established state of Pakistan sent its forces behind
a front of tribal militia and moved menacingly towards
Srinagar. It was now that the prince was forced to sign an
Instrument of Accession (October 1947) with the Indian
Union, endorsed by the popular leader Sheikh Abdullah.
Indian troops were despatched to defend the state against the
raiders from Pakistan. India’s complaints to the UN Security
Council regarding raids from Pakistan and the Indian offer
to settle the status of the state through a plebiscite led to
a ceasefire but left 84,000 square km of area under Pakistani
occupation. The special status of Jammu and Kashmir was
recognised under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution
which implied a limited jurisdiction of the Indian Union over
the state as compared to other states.

Gradual Integration

The problem now was two-fold—
(i) of transforming the states into viable administrative
units, and
(ii) of absorbing them into the constitutional units.
This was sought to be solved by—
1. incorporating smaller states (216 such states) into
contiguous provinces and listed in Part A; for

The Indian States

 609

instance, 39 states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh were
incorporated into Central Provinces, Orissa. Gujarat
states were incorporated into Bombay;
2. making some states as centrally administered for
strategic or special reasons, listed in Part-C (61
states)— Himachal Pradesh, Vindhya Pradesh,
Manipur, Tripura, Bhopal, etc.;
3. creating five unions—United States of Kathiawar,
United States of Matsya, Patiala and East Punjab
States Union, Rajasthan, and United States of
Travancore-Cochin (later Kerala).
Initially these states acceded with respect to defence,
communication, external affairs; later they felt that a closer
association was necessary. The five unions and Mysore
accepted Indian jurisdiction in Union, concurrent subjects
except taxation and subject to differences as under Article
238 and the supervisory power of Union for ten years.
The Seventh Amendment (1956) abolished Part-B states
as a class and formed one class out of Parts A and B; thus
special provisions relating to Part B states were deleted.
The Indian states thus became part of one uniform
political set-up.

Chapter 35

Making of the
Constitution for India
The Indian Constitution, which came into effect on January
26, 1950, has the distinction of being the longest in the world
in terms of its length, content and complexity owing to
country’s size and diversity. At the time of framing of the
constitution, India was deeply divided besides being large and
diverse, and hence it was designed in a way to keep the
country together. If in one way, it sought to make Indians
of different classes, castes and communities come together
for a shared vision, in another way it sought to nurture
democratic institutions in what had long been a culture of
hierarchy and deference.

Background
Although the Constitution of India was framed between
December 1946 and December 1949, its roots deep lie in
the Indian national movement against the colonial rule as well
as in the movements for responsible and constitutional
government in the princely states.
Mridula Mukherjee, in her work, India Since
Independence, has rejected the idea that the British initiated
modern, responsible and constitutional government in India
and that the 1950 Constitution was merely the culmination
of the series of constitutional initiatives made by the British
in 1861, 1892, 1909, 1919 and 1935. The fact that British
610

Making of the Constitution for India

 611

concessions, at every stage, fell far short of what nationalists
were demanding for.
In the modern sense, there appeared the Constitution
of India Bill, also known as the Home Rule Bill in 1895,
which envisaged basic human rights such as freedom of
expression, equality before the law, right to the inviolability
of one’s home, right to property, etc., for all citizens of India.
Although, there is no conclusive evidence to prove the
authorship of the Home Rule Bill, Annie Besant believed that
the Bill was inspired by Tilak.
In 1922, Mahatma Gandhi, in an article titled
‘Independence’ published in Young India, wrote that Swaraj
would not be a free gift of the British Parliament but a
declaration of India’s full self-expression—the Constitution
of India would be framed as per the wishes of the Indians.
The Commonwealth of India Bill, which was drafted in
India and to which Annie Besant, Tej Bahadur Sapru, V.S.
Srinivasa Shastri made important contributions, was accepted
unanimously by the executive committee of the Parliamentary
Labour Party. The Bill had its first reading in the House of
Commons in December 1925; it was defeated, but it proved
crucial as it had the support of very wide sections of Indian
opinion, and specified in clear words that “India shall be
placed on an equal footing with the self-governing dominions”.
After the Non-Cooperation Movement, Motilal Nehru
in February 1924 introduced in the Central Legislative
Assembly a resolution that gave due regard to minority rights
and interests and came to be known as the National Demand.
It was passed by a large majority in the Assembly. For the
first time, a demand for a constitution and the procedure for
its adoption were expounded in clear terms.
Britain, in response to the National Demand, appointed
the all-white Simon Commission in November 1927 to
recommend further constitutional changes.
In response to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, the Nehru
Report, submitted on August 1928, was an outline of a draft
constitution for India. Most of its features were later
incorporated in the Constitution of independent India.
The Report embodied not only the perspective of the
contemporary nationalist opinion but also an outline of a draft

612  

constitution for India. The latter was based on the principle
of dominion status with full responsible government on the
parliamentary pattern. It asserted the principle that sovereignty
belongs to the Indian people, laid down a set of fundamental
rights and provided for a federal system with maximum
autonomy granted to the units but residuary powers vesting
in the central government and joint electorates for elections
to the federal lower house and the provincial legislatures with
reservation of seats for minorities in certain cases for a
limited period.
In the aftermath of the Nehru Report, the Simon
Commission was boycotted and in December 1929, the
Congress declared complete independence as its ultimate
goal. The idea that India’s Constitution should be framed via
a Constituent Assembly elected for this very purpose and
based on widest possible franchise gained support. Although,
M.N. Roy had made such a suggestion earlier, Jawaharlal
Nehru was the first national leader to enunciate the idea in
1933.
The Congress took up the demand for a constituent
assembly as a part of its official policy in 1934 after refusing
the Simon Commission’s recommendations of 1933 as not
expressive of the will of the people. Jawaharlal Nehru
declared that the Congress had proposed “the Constitution
of India must be framed, without outside interference, by a
Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise”,
and, the Working Committee of the Congress reiterated the
stand. At the Lucknow session of the Congress in 1936, it
was declared that “no constitution imposed by an outside
authority and no constitution which curtails the sovereignty
of the people” would be acceptable to the Congress.
In July 1937, after the Congress accepted office in a
majority of provinces, Nehru pressed the legislators to
introduce resolutions in the assemblies rejecting the present
constitution and demanding a Constituent Assembly. In
August, the CWC accepted a draft resolution prepared under
Acharya Kripalani. Between August and October 1937, all the
Congress ruled provinces and Sind passed this resolution and
demanded repealment of the Government of India Act, 1935.
In September 1937 itself, a resolution recommending the

Making of the Constitution for India

 613

replacement of the 1935 Act by a constitution framed by
a constituent assembly was introduced in the Central
Legislative Assembly by S. Satyamurti. The same demand was
reiterated in the Haripura session of 1938.
The Cripps Proposals of 1942, though rejected by the
Congress as unacceptable, had one redeeming feature in that
it conceded the request of Indians to frame their own
constitution through a constituent assembly.
In September 1945, the newly elected Labour
government in England announced that it planned to create
a constituent assembly in India. On March 15, 1946, the
Cabinet Mission came to India and, in the course of its stay,
recommended the forming of (a) the Constituent Assembly,
and (b) an interim government.

Constituent Assembly
Formation

It was decided that the Constituent Assembly was to be
elected indirectly by the Provincial Assemblies. According
to the plan, the provinces of British India were grouped into
three categories, A, B and C. Each province was allotted seats
on the basis of the population, in the ratio of one member
for a million. The seats given to a province were decided
among three communities on the basis of their number, the
three communities being the Muslims, Sikhs and General
including Hindus and all others who were not Muslims and
Sikhs. They were to be elected by the representatives of each
community in their respective legislative assemblies by the
method of proportional representation with single transferable
vote. The number of members allotted to the Indian states
was also to be fixed on the same basis of population as
adopted for British India, but the method of their selection
was to be settled later by consultation. The strength of the
constitution-making body was to be 389. Of these, 296
representatives were to be from British India, (292
representatives drawn from the eleven Governors’ Provinces
of British India and a representative each from the four Chief
Commissioners’ Provinces of Delhi, Ajmer-Merwara, Coorg
and British Baluchistan) and 93 representatives from the

614  

Indian states. The states’ representatives were to be nominated
by the respective rulers.
Elections for the 296 seats assigned to the British
Indian Provinces were completed by July-August 1946. The
Congress won 208 seats including all the General seats
except nine and the Muslim League 73 seats, that is, all but
five of the seats allotted to Muslims.
The 93 seats meant for the states’ representatives
remained vacant and the princely states decided not to
participate in the Constituent Assembly. However,
representatives of some of the states (Baroda, Bikaner,
Jaipur, Patiala, Rewa, and Udaipur) entered the Assembly by
April 1947 and by August 15, 1947 and, soon after, all the
states had sent their representatives to the Assembly.
The Assembly was, however, not able to start its work
immediately as Jinnah withdrew his acceptance and caused
the Muslim League to boycott it. The Congress went ahead
with its plan and appointed an expert committee to draft
Fundamental Rights and arrange an early session of the
Assembly. The party also accepted the viceroy’s invitation
to form an interim government, with Jawaharlal Nehru as
prime minister. The Constituent Assembly opened on
December 9, 1946 in the Constitution Hall—now the Central
Hall of Parliament House at New Delhi. Jawaharlal Nehru
moved the historic Objectives Resolution on 13 December
1946, after it had been in session for some days. The
resolution envisaged a federal polity with the residuary
powers vesting in the autonomous units and sovereignty
belonging to the people. The Resolution gave to the Assembly
its guiding principles and the philosophy of constitutionmaking.

Two Constituent Assemblies: India and
Pakistan

By the end of January 1947, it was clear that there was no
possibility of the Muslim League’s joining the Assembly; an
uncompromising call for a separate constituent assembly for
Pakistan had been given by Jinnah. On June 26, 1947, Lord
Mountbatten, the Governor-General, announced the setting up
of a separate Constituent Assembly for Pakistan. The Indian

Making of the Constitution for India

 615

Independence Act, 1947, passed with surprising speed, came
into force on July 18, 1947.
The Indian Independence Act, 1947 declared the
Constituent Assembly of India to be a fully sovereign body
and on the midnight of August 14-15, 1947, the Assembly
assumed full powers of the governance of the country.
Section 8 of the Act conferred on the Constituent Assembly
full legislative power.

Evaluation of the Assembly for India

The assembly, set up under the Cabinet Mission Plan, was
a result of compromises made by the Congress on its
ideological and philosophical sphere. The assembly was not
fully sovereign despite the efforts of the Congress, whereas
the Congress’ demand was for a fully sovereign assembly.
Nor was it elected on the basis of universal adult franchise
as the Congress had demanded. The Congress caved in to
accept communal representation too, and the grouping plan
for the provinces. It also went along with the limits imposed
on the powers of the central government. So the Constituent
Assembly set up was quite far from what the Congress had
demanded in the later years of the freedom struggle.
The Constituent Assembly was indirectly elected by the
provincial assemblies which themselves were elected on the
basis of a limited franchise established by the Government
of India Act of 1935. The 1935 Act imposed qualifications
on the basis of tax, property and education. This kept out
more than 70 per cent of the adult population from the voting.
The Constituent Assembly thus reflected the composition of
the provincial assemblies in which the Congress had a
comfortable majority (which rose to more than 80 per cent
after partition).
The composition of the Assembly reflected the different
ideological views present in the country at the time. There
were Socialists, the Marxian as well as the democratic
variety. Both groups were opposed to private ownership of
important means of production and wanted an egalitarian
society; while the Marxian variety wanted a revolutionary
reconstruction. It was the more moderate group (of which
Nehru was a member) preferring peaceful parliamentary

616  

methods that held sway. Sardar Patel may be considered a
leader of the Rightist views supporting private enterprise. The
rightist point of view was also represented by Purushottam
Das Tandon and S.P. Mukherjee. There were also the
Gandhians proposing decentralised village government through
panchayats. All these viewpoints influenced the Constitution,
to an extent, but the dominant influence was that of the
liberals and the democratic socialists.

After Independence

With the independence of India on August 15, 1947, the
Constituent Assembly became a sovereign body responsible
for framing the constitution as well as making ordinary laws.
Now the work of Constituent Assembly was organised into
five stages: first—committees were required to present
reports on basic issues; second—Benegal Narsing Rau, a
judge of the Calcutta High Court and also the constitutional
adviser of the constituent assembly, prepared an initial draft
on the basis of the reports of these committees and on his
own research into the constitutions of other countries;
third—the drafting committee, under the chairmanship of Dr
B.R. Ambedkar, presented a detailed draft constitution which
was published for public discussion and comments. Criticisms
and counter-criticisms in the press in turn moulded the nature
of the consensus that was ultimately reached on specific
issues; fourth—the draft constitution was debated and
amendments proposed; fifth—the Constitution of India was
adopted.
Drafting Committee
(1) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (Chairman) (2) G.B. Pant (3) K.M. Munshi
(4) Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer (5) N. Gopalaswami Ayengar (6) B.L.
Mitra (later replaced with Madhav Rao) (7) Sayyid Muhammad
Sadullah (7) D.P. Khaitan died in 1948 and hence T.T. Krishnamachari
was appointed.

Work : Committees and Consensus

When the Constituent Assembly first met on December 9,
1946, J.B. Kripalani, the then Congress president, proposed

Making of the Constitution for India

 617

the name of Dr Sachhidanand Sinha, the oldest member of
the Assembly, for the post of the provisional president. Later,
on December 11, Dr Rajendra Prasad was elected as the
President of the Constituent Assembly.
The Constituent Assembly appointed several committees
for framing the constitution.
These committees submitted their reports between
April and August 1947 and on the basis of these reports, Dr
B.N. Rau, the Constitutional Adviser, submitted a draft of the
Constitution by the end of October 1947. This draft contained
240 Clauses and 13 Schedules. In order to consider this Draft
Constitution, a Drafting Committee under the chairmanship
of Dr B.R. Ambedkar (the law minister at the time) was set
up. (The other members were: Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer,
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar, K.M. Munshi, Saiyad Mohammad
Saadulla, Sir B.L. Mitter and D.P. Khaitan. After the first
meeting Sir B.L. Mitter resigned and in his place N. Madhava
Rao was nominated, and T.T. Krishnamachari took the place
of D.P. Khaitan on the latter’s death in 1948.)
The Drafting Committee prepared the first draft of the
Constitution. This was then circulated for the comments of
jurists, lawyers, judges and other publicmen. In the light of
their comments and criticism, the Drafting Committee
prepared a second draft which consisted of 315 Articles and
9 Schedules. This second draft was placed before the
Constituent Assembly on February 21, 1948. The draft was
then considered clause by clause by the Assembly. The third
reading commenced on November 14 and was finished on
November 26, 1949. The Preamble was adopted last. It had
taken 2 years, 11 months and 18 days to complete the task.
As many as 7000 odd amendments had been proposed and
nearly 2500 were actually discussed before the draft
constitution was accepted.
Dr Ambedkar then moved a motion that the Constitution
as settled by the Constituent Assembly be passed. On
November 26, 1949, the people of India in the Constituent
Assembly adopted, enacted and gave to themselves the
Constitution of the Sovereign Democratic Republic of India.
Dr Rajendra Prasad as president of the assembly signed the
document.
The members of the Constituent Assembly appended

their signatures to it on January 24, 1950—the last day of
the Assembly. In all, 284 members actually signed the
Constitution.
The Constituent Assembly, besides drafting the
Constitution of India, adopted the National Flag on July 22,
1947, and adopted the National Anthem and National Song
on January 24, 1950—the last day of its session.
The Constituent Assembly elected Dr Rajendra Prasad
as the first President of India on January 24, 1950.
Late in the evening of August 14, 1947, the Assembly
met in the Constitution Hall and at the stroke of midnight,
took over as the Legislative Assembly of an Independent
India.
The Assembly continued as the provisional Parliament
of India from January 26, 1950 till the new Parliament was
installed after the first general elections.
It must, however, be noted that while the formal centres
of the work of drafting the Constitution were, no doubt, the
Constituent Assembly and the Drafting Committee, the
Congress leaders held the important powers of decisionmaking. In a way, the Congress Working Committee was the
real architect of the Constitution in that most of the
important decisions were arrived at on the basis of what the
Congress leaders suggested. Granville Austin points out that
four men—Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad
and Abul Kalam Azad—constituted a virtual oligarchy in the
Assembly and dominated the proceedings by virtue of the
prestige and power they enjoyed both in the Congress and
in the government.
The manner in which the Constituent Assembly arrived
at decisions was that of consensus, defined by Granville
Austin as “the manner of making decisions by unanimity or
near unanimity”. An effort was made to smoothen differences
and arrive at compromises and agreement. The objective was
to overcome the biases, and an element of overruling dissent,
ingrained in decision by majority.

The Evolution of Nationalist Foreign Policy

 619

Chapter 36

The Evolution of
Nationalist Foreign Policy
One of the factors that facilitated India’s ready interaction
with the world outside, immediately on independence, was
the already well-established diplomatic engagement even
under colonial rule. At independence, India was a member
of 51 international organisations and a signatory to 600 odd
treaties. India had signed the Versailles Treaty after the First
World War, largely as a result of having contributed more
than a million soldiers to that war. In the 1920s, it was a
founding member of the League of Nations, the International
Labour Organisation, and the International Court of Justice.
It participated in the Washington Conference on Naval
Armaments in 1921-22. From 1920 there was an Indian high
commissioner in London. Even before the First World War,
Indian nationals were staffing a few diplomatic posts. It was
no accident that Indians formed the largest and most influential
non-Western contingent in the United Nations and allied
agencies very soon after independence.
The basic framework of India’s foreign policy was
structured much before 1947.
A significant and inevitable fallout of the Western
influence on the nationalist intelligentsia was a growing
interest in and contact with the dominant international
currents and events. Gradually, the nationalist thinkers came
to realise that colonialism and imperialism had an international
619

620  

character and much wider implications. With the development
and crystallisation of an anti-imperialist nationalist ideology,
there emerged a nationalist foreign policy perspective. The
evolution of this policy perspective can be traced under these
broad phases.

1880 to First World War: AntiImperialism and Pan-Asian
Feeling
After 1878, the British undertook a number of expansionist
expeditions which were opposed by the nationalists. These
expeditions included—
● the Second Afghan War (1878-80);
● the dispatch of troops by England in 1882, to
suppress the nationalist uprising by Col. Arabi in
Egypt;
● annexation of Burma in 1885;
● invasion of Tibet under Curzon in 1903; and
● a number of annexations during the 1890s in the
north-west to stop the Russian advance. The
nationalists supported the tribal resistance to these
adventures by the British.
In place of an aggressive imperialism, the nationalists
advocated a policy of peace. C. Sankaran Nair, the Congress
president in 1897, said, “Our true policy is a peaceful policy.”
So, the emerging themes during 1880-1914 were—
1. solidarity with other colonies fighting for freedom,
such as Russia, Ireland, Egypt, Turkey, Ethiopia, Sudan,
Burma and Afghanistan;
2. pan-Asian feeling reflected in—
● condemnation of annexation of Burma in 1885,
● inspiration from Japan as an example of industrial
development,
● condemnation of the participation of Japan in the
international suppression of the I-Ho-Tuan uprising
(1895),
● condemnation of the imperialist efforts to divide
China,

●
●

 621

defeat of the Czarist Russia by Japan which exploded
the myth of European superiority,
Congress support for Burma’s freedom.

World War I
The nationalists supported the British Indian Government in
the belief that Britain would apply the same principles of
democracy for which they were supposed to be fighting. After
the conclusion of the War, the Congress insisted on being
represented at the Peace Conference. In 1920, the Congress
urged the people not to join the Army to fight in the West.
In 1925, the Congress condemned the dispatch of Indian
Army to suppress the Chinese nationalist army under SunYat-Sen.

1920s and 1930s—Identifying
with Socialists
In 1926 and 1927, Nehru was in Europe where he came in
contact with the socialists and other leftist leaders. Earlier,
Dadabhai Naoroji attended the Hague session of the
International Socialist Congress. He was a close friend of
H.M. Hyndman, the famous socialist. Lajpat Rai also made
contacts with the American socialists during his visit to the
USA from 1914 to 1918. Gandhi had close relations with
Tolstoy and Rolland Romain. In 1927, Nehru attended the
Congress of Oppressed Nationalists at Brussels on behalf of
the Indian National Congress. The conference was organised
by political exiles and revolutionaries from Asia, Africa and
Latin America, suffering from political and economic
imperialism. Nehru was one of the honorary presidents along
with Einstein, Madam Sun-Yet-Sen, Rolland Romain and
George Lansbury. Nehru came to understand the international
character of US imperialism during his European experience.
Nehru was also nominated to the executive council of the
League Against Imperialism. The Congress also decided to
open a foreign department to be in touch with the other
peoples’ movements. In 1927, Nehru also visited the Soviet

622  

Union and was very impressed by the achievements of the
infant socialist state. He saw Russia as a bulwark against
imperialism.

After 1936—Anti-Fascism
The 1930s saw the rise of Fascism in Europe and the struggle
against it. The nationalists saw imperialism and fascism as
organs of capitalism. They lend support to the struggle against
fascism in other parts of the world in Ethiopia, Spain, China,
Czechoslovakia. In 1939, at the Tripuri session, the Congress
dissociated itself from the British policy which supported
fascism in Europe.
In 1939, the Japanese attack on China was condemned
by the nationalists. The Congress also sent a medical mission
under Dr Atal to China.
On the Palestine issue, the Congress lent support to
the Palestinians. It expressed sympathy with the Jews, but
urged that the Palestinians not be displaced and that the issue
be settled by direct dealing between the Jews and the Arabs
without Western intervention. It also opposed the partition
of Palestine.

After Independence
Nehru is often called the architect of independent India’s
foreign policy. He realised the importance of the need to
have direct contact with other nations and to cooperate with
them in enhancing world peace and freedom; he also
understood the importance of maintaining an identity as a free
nation and not become a satellite of any other nation, however
mighty. In his address to the Constituent Assembly on
December 4, 1947, Nehru laid the foundations of India’s
foreign policy: “....the art of conducting the foreign affairs
of a country lies in finding out what is most advantageous
to the country. We may talk about peace and freedom and
earnestly mean what we say. But in the ultimate analysis, a
government functions for the good of the country it governs,
and no government dare do anything which in the short or
long run is manifestly to the disadvantage of the country.”
The main challenge to Nehru was to evolve a policy

The Evolution of Nationalist Foreign Policy

 623

that could help India compete on the world arena with the
modern states, and for that, he realised, a drastic socioeconomic and technological transformation of the country
was required. His objective was to transform India without
becoming dependent on any particular country or group of
countries to the extent of losing independence of thought
or policy. What India needed was peaceful relations with all
nations so that it could concentrate on its developmental
efforts, and relations good enough for it to get the necessary
help in that direction without compromising its freedom. In
the circumstances, non-alignment seemed to be the right
policy.

Panchsheel and Non-Alignment

Panchsheel and Non-Alignment are the foundations of India’s
foreign policy.
Panchsheel
It was on April 29, 1954, that Panchsheel, or the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, were first formally
enunciated in the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse
between the Tibet region of China and India. It was stated
in the preamble to this agreement that the two governments
had resolved to enter into the agreement on the basis of five
principles, namely,
(i) Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity
and sovereignty
(ii) Mutual non-aggression
(iii) Mutual non-interference
(iv) Equality and mutual benefit
(v) Peaceful co-existence.
In June 1954, when the Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai
visited India, he and his Indian counterpart, Jawaharlal Nehru
in a joint statement elaborated their vision of Panchsheel as
the framework for the relations between the two countries
as well as the basis on which relations with other countries
should be maintained. The two leaders expressed the hope
that Panchsheel “will also help in creating an area of peace
which as circumstances permit can be enlarged thus lessening
the chances of war and strengthening the cause of peace all
over the world.”

624  

Historical Perspective on Panchsheel
In the classical language, the word ‘sheel’ doesn’t mean ‘principle’
but ‘character’. The term is taken from the Indonesian usage of
the word — and Indonesians may have been influenced by Buddhist
use of the word ‘sheel’. Most Indians think ‘Panchsheel’ was
Jawaharlal Nehru’s valuable contribution to the world, as it first
received world attention when he and Zhou Enlai issued a joint
statement in Delhi on June 18, 1954. In fact, the credit for
formulating these principles should go to Zhou. While receiving the
Indian delegation to the Tibetan trade talks on December 31, 1953,
he enunciated them as “five principles governing China’s relations
with foreign countries”.
T.N. Kaul, a joint secretary in the external affairs ministry
at the time or Director General for Asian Affairs in Delhi, was
impressed and conveyed his appreciation and the significance of
these principles to Nehru, with whom he enjoyed a close rapport.
Nehru agreed and Kaul took the initiative to mention them at the
very outset of his draft text of agreement. That was in January
1954. However, the response from the Chinese foreign office was
in the negative. At the time Zhou wasn’t in China.
When Zhou returned to Peking, he, with his native genius for
compromise, found a via-media. He suggested that the five
principles may not be included in the main text prominently, but
could appear in the preamble. India accepted the compromise. But
two months later, when Zhou visited Delhi, Nehru and Kaul
emphasised these principles in the joint statement issued on June
18, 1954. China’s hesitant formulation caught worldwide attention
because of Indian sponsorship. Zhou propounded the principles but
Kaul picked them up and Nehru propagated them. Nehru enjoyed
high regard in the NAM and soon other Asian countries like Burma
and Indonesia followed suit.
Nehru and Zhou were leaders who strove hard to forge close
ties between India and China and usher in a better world order
through Panchsheel. Their efforts, however, were undermined and
undone by the machinations of self-seeking or vindictive colleagues
and they died disenchanted men.

The Evolution of Nationalist Foreign Policy

As per the documents of the Ministry of External
Affairs, Panchsheel was incorporated into the Ten Principles
of International Peace and Cooperation put forward in the
Declaration issued by the April 1955 Bandung Conference
of 29 Afro-Asian countries. The universal relevance of
Panchsheel was emphasised when its tenets were incorporated
in a resolution on peaceful co-existence presented by India,
Yugoslavia and Sweden, and unanimously adopted on December
11, 1957, by the United Nations General Assembly. And in
1961, the Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Belgrade
accepted Panchsheel as the basic principles at the centre of
the Non-Aligned Movement.
Non-Alignment
The global environment that India faced after independence
was very different from what existed before the Second
World War. The major players on the world stage before the
War, namely, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and
Japan, lay subdued, their vast empires shrunken or shrinking
fast. The United States, which had followed an isolationist
policy, keeping aloof from active international involvement,
became dramatically active. The Soviet Union had acquired
unprecedented influence in Eastern Europe besides gaining
recognition as a powerful state for crushing the German
might on the Eastern Front where most of the German
military casualties had occurred. If the US demonstrated its
nuclear weapon capability in 1945, the USSR followed suit
with its own nuclear test in 1949. The Cold War that began
in the wake of the Second World War had no precedent in
history. Almost the entire developed world was divided into
two opposing nuclear-armed blocs, with the US and the USSR
leading as ‘super powers’. The balance of power diplomacy
of the pre-war years thus disappeared from the industrialised
countries. The Third World became a surrogate field for
super power competition. Meanwhile, decolonisation was
proceeding apace, and more and more independent countries
were emerging, mostly in Asia and Africa. China was aligned
with the Soviet Union till the mid-fifties. India found itself
the largest country with the ability to manoeuvre between the
two blocs.

626  

At this point of time, the Soviet Union did not possess
the economic or military support capability to influence the
countries emerging from the colonial yoke. It was the West,
which tried to incorporate the newly independent countries
into its strategic grouping. Alignment with the West was
economically attractive, but it would have created a dependent
relationship, which was seen by most of the newly independent
countries as obstructive to a self-reliant development. The
idea of aligning with the communist bloc was not possible
for India, in spite of its socialist leanings; it could not
visualise a Chinese-type restructuring of the society and
economy, being basically attuned to a liberal democratic
political vision. Political non-alignment was, therefore,
prudent as well as pragmatic.
The principles of non-interference in the domestic
affairs of other countries and maintenance of one’s own
sovereignty (which are the basic postulates of India’s foreign
policy) evolved into the crystallisation of the concept of
non-alignment. The term ‘non-alignment’ got currency in the
post-Bandung Conference (1955). Non-alignment implies
Five Criteria of Non-alignment
The Preparatory Committee of the first non-aligned conference laid
down the following five criteria of non-alignment:
(i) A country should follow an independent policy based on
peaceful co-existence and non-alignment.
(ii) It should have consistently supported national freedom
movements in other countries.
(iii) It should not be a member of multi-lateral military alliances
concluded in the context of super-power conflicts.
(iv) If it has conceded military bases, these concessions should
not have been made in the context of super-power conflicts.
(v) If it is a member of a bilateral or regional defence arrangements,
this should not be in the context of super-power politics.
Five Pioneering Leaders of the NAM
(i) President Tito (original name Josip Broz) of Yugoslavia
(ii) President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt
(iii) President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana
(iv) President Sukarno of Indonesia
(v) Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India

the active refusal of a state to align itself with either party
in a dispute between two power blocs. In the conference of
non-aligned powers—the first non-aligned movement or
NAM summit—held in Belgrade in 1961 and attended by
36 Mediterranean and Afro-Asian powers, Jawaharlal Nehru
explained the essence of non-alignment: “We call ourselves
the conference of non-aligned countries. Now the word nonaligned may be differently interpreted but basically it was
used and coined almost with the meaning: non aligned with
greater power blocs of the world. Non-aligned has a negative
meaning but if you give it a positive connotation it means
nations which object to this lining up for war purpose,
military blocs, military alliances and the like. Therefore, we
keep away from this and we want to throw our weight, such
as it is, in favour of peace”.
Non-alignment is the characteristic feature of India’s
foreign policy. India was one of the founder-members of
NAM. In the Cold War era, India refused to favour any super
power and remained non-aligned. Non-alignment, however, is
not to be confused with neutrality. A neutral state remains
inactive or passive during hostilities between two blocs.
Neutrality is maintained basically in times of war, whereas
non-alignment has relevance both in times of war and peace.
Neutrality is equivalent to passivity, a neutral country has no
opinions (positive or negative) on issues at all. However,
adherence to non-alignment is to have positive and constructive
opinions on international issues. India has firmly and
convincingly asserted its ‘non-aligned’ and not ‘neutral’ stand
on various issues. Non-alignment as one of the principles
of India’s foreign policy attempts to promote international
peace, disarmament and territorial independence. It aims at
democratisation of international relations by putting an end
to imperialism and hegemony and establishing a just and equal
world order.

Chapter 37

First General Elections
With the Constitution coming into force in 1950, India no
longer had a dominion status and could sever any remaining
links with Britain; it was a sovereign democratic republic.
The provisions of the Constitution relating to citizenship and
Article 324 (the Election Commission) were brought into
force on November 26, 1949, while the rest of the
Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950. The next
year, the government wanted to go in for general elections
to constitute the House of the People—the Lok Sabha—as
provided for in the Constitution.
The founding fathers of the Indian Constitution
incorporated certain aspects of the electoral procedure in the
Constitution itself (Part XV, Articles 324 to 329).

Groundwork for the Elections
The Election Commission

The office of the Election Commission had been set up in
a small way on January 25, 1950. The first Chief Election
Commissioner of India was Sukumar Sen, an ICS officer, who
assumed office on March 21, 1950. Although the Constitution
provides for the appointment of other members of the
Election Commission as and when necessary, for long after
India became a republic the commission was a single-member
one.
The Election Commission of India is a permanent
constitutional body, established in accordance with the
Constitution. It has been made independent of the government
628

First General Elections

 629

of the day. Under Article 324, the Election Commission of
India has been vested with the power of the superintendence,
direction and control of the entire process for conduct of
elections to Parliament and legislature of every state and to
the offices of President and Vice-President of India. The
Election Commission had to do a lot of ground work before
the first polls were held.

Legislation for Polls

Two major measures were passed by Parliament which
provided the detailed law under which elections were to be
held. The first of these measures was the Representation of
the People Act, 1950, which provided for the qualifications
of voters and matters connected with the preparation and
publication of electoral rolls. It also allocated the number
of seats in the House of the People to the several states
and fixed the number of seats in each state legislature. The
second legislation was the Representation of the People Act,
1951, which laid down other provisions relating to
qualifications and disqualifications of members, the conduct
of elections, poll expenses, the poll itself, counting of votes,
etc.
It was only after these laws were passed that the
electoral machinery could be put in place. So, though the
government was in a hurry to hold the elections as early as
1950 and then by the spring of 1951, the first phase of the
elections could be held only from October 15, 1951.
Of the 489 seats in the House of the People to be filled
by election, 72 seats were reserved for candidates belonging
to the Scheduled Castes, and 26 for candidates belonging to
the Scheduled Tribes.
The total number of seats in the Legislative Assemblies
of the states was 3,283. Out of these, 477 seats were reserved
for the Scheduled Castes, and 192 for the Scheduled Tribes.

Independent India Goes to the
Polls for the First Time
The elections were held based on universal adult franchise,
with all those twenty-one years of age or older having the
right to vote. The total number of voters enrolled in the whole
of India (excluding Jammu and Kashmir) was 17,32,13,635

630  

(roughly more than 173 million). Of these, approximately 45
per cent were women voters. The total population of India
(excluding Jammu and Kashmir) according to the 1951
census was 35,66,91,760. As much as 49 per cent of the
total population was thus enrolled as voters.

Challenges

Most of the voters were poor, illiterate, and came from rural
areas, and had no experience of elections. There was much
scepticism about such an electorate being able to exercise
its right to vote in a politically mature and responsible
manner. The electoral exercise was described by some as ‘a
leap in the dark’ and by others as ‘fantastic’ and as ‘an act
of faith’ before the elections took place.
The Election Commission faced many challenges. There
was a house-to-house survey to register the voters. Many
eligible voters could not be included in the electoral rolls
despite much effort on the part of the Election Commission
because of (i) ignorance and apathy of the common voter,
(ii) lack of adequate organisation and experience on the part
of the political parties, and (iii) inexperience and poor
organisation of the governmental machinery in some of the
states.
According to the report by Sukumar Sen after the
elections were over, a large number of women voters had
been enrolled in some states not by their own names but by
the description of the relationship they bore to their male
relations, e.g., as the mother of so and so or the wife of
so and so; this was because local custom dictated that women
do not disclose their proper names to strangers. The Election
Commission had to issue firm instructions that, as the name
of an elector was an essential part of his or her identity,
the correct name must be included in the electoral rolls and
that no elector should be enrolled unless sufficient particulars,
including the name, were given. If a woman did not give her
proper name, she was not to be registered as a voter. As a
result, the names of nearly two to three million out of a total
of nearly 80 million women voters in the country were unable
to be registered as they failed to disclose their proper names,
and these women could not exercise their vote. Most of these
women, says the report, were from the states of Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, Rajasthan and Vindhya Pradesh.

First General Elections

 631

The Election Commission also faced a major problem
with regard to the displaced persons (who had migrated from
Pakistan in the wake of partition) in West Bengal, Punjab,
Delhi and, to some extent, in Assam. These migrants
constituted a considerable floating population, and it was very
difficult to register those of them that were eligible for
registration under the law.
Political parties in a mature democracy participate in
all stages of the process of elections. The parties could be
of great help in the preparation of electoral rolls. However,
India was a nascent democracy and political parties lacked
experience; they took little interest in doing their bit. As it
was, the huge task of preparing the electoral rolls in a country
of some 173 million voters had to be borne almost entirely
by the governmental machinery in the states acting under the
directions of the Election Commission.
With over 70 per cent of the voters being illiterate,
it was necessary for candidates to be identified by symbols.
The Election Commission had to allot a symbol to each major
party and independent candidate. At the time of allotment of
symbols the political parties became more active. Indeed,
according to the Sen report, a remarkable feature of the
increasing tempo was the formation of new political parties
all over the country, some of them ultimately proving to be
a mushroom growth. There were as many as 178 parties but
most of these parties virtually disappeared after the elections,
with many of their candidates forfeiting their deposits.
The symbols were painted on the ballot-boxes (this was
later changed to symbols on the ballot papers). “A voter had
to simply insert the ballot paper given to him in the ballot
box of the candidate of his choice in the voting compartment,”
writes former Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi
in his book, An Undocumented Wonder: The Making of the
Great Indian Election. The ballot was secret.

Parties in the Fray for the Lok Sabha

Though it was generally accepted that the Congress had the
largest following, various other political strands in India were
also beginning to take shape. Just before the first elections,
Shyama Prasad Mookeree (industries minister under Nehru)
broke away to set up the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (a proto-BJP)
in October 1951. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar revived the Scheduled

632  

Castes Federation (which was later named the Republican
Party). Another high-profile Congress leader, J. B. (Acharya)
Kripalani, founded the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party. Ram
Manohar Lohia and Jaya Prakash Narayan, were the forces
behind the Socialist Party. And the communists (then united),
having just abandoned an armed struggle in Telangana, too
contested.
There were 53 political parties participating in the first
general elections for the Lok Sabha seats. These included
the 14 national parties, according to the report by the
Election Commission of India. Besides, there were the
independents. There were a total number of 1,874 candidates,
including 533 independents.
The national parties were:
1. All India Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS)
2. Bolshevik Party of India (BPI)
3. Communist Party of India (CPI)
4. Forward Bloc (Marxist Group) FBL (MG)
5. Forward Bloc (Ruikar Group) FBL (RG)
6. Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (HMS)
7. Indian National Congress (INC)
8. Krishikar Lok Party (KLP)
9. Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP)
10. Revolutionary Communist Party of India (RCPI)
11. Akhil Bharatiya Ram Rajya Parishad (RRP)
12. Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP)
13. All India Scheduled Caste Federation (SCF)
14. Socialist Party (SP)

Conduct of Elections

In the first general elections of the nation, there were three
types of constituencies: 314 with single seats, 86 with two
seats and one with three seats. The total seats thus were 489
from 401 constituencies.
There were over 224,000 polling booths, one for
almost every 1000 voters, and these were equipped with over
2 million steel ballot-boxes, one box for every candidate.
About a million officials supervised the conduct of the polls.
Indelible ink was introduced as a precautionary step:
a mark was put on the voter’s finger as he/she went in to
vote so as to prevent impersonation. (The practice continues
to this day.)

First General Elections

 633

The first-past-the-post system was the mode, so of the
many candidates, whoever got the plurality or the largest
number of votes would be elected; the winning candidate did
not need to have a majority.
The voter turnout for the elections was 45.7 per cent.
The people demonstrated their ability to vote with knowledge
even though the majority of them were illiterate. The number
of invalid votes was as low as 3 to 4 per cent. The
participation of women was significant with some 40 per cent
of the eligible women voters exercising their vote.

Results
Lok Sabha
The Indian National Congress contested 472 seats and won
364, a stupendous majority of the seats to the Lok Sabha.
The CPI won 16 and the Socialist Party won 12 – the only
other parties to get two-digit number of seats. The KMPP
won 9 seats.The BJS won 3 seats. The independents got the
highest number of seats after the Congress.
The Congress polled close to 45 per cent of the total
vote. The CPI got about 3.29 per cent votes. The Socialist
Party got 10.59 per cent votes.
Some prominent winners were: Gulzari Lal Nanda and
Lal Bahadur Shastri who were to be future prime ministers;
Delhi’s first chief minister to be, Chaudhry Brahm Prakash;
Humayun Kabir, A.K. Gopalan, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, K.D.
Malviya and Subhadra Joshi.
Dr B. R. Ambedkar was defeated in the Bombay (North
Central), which was a reserved constituency, as a candidate
of the Scheduled Castes Federation by his little-known
former assistant and Congress candidate, Narayan Sadoba
Kajrolkar. (Dr Ambedkar later entered Parliament as a Rajya
Sabha member.)
Acharya Kripalani as the KMPP candidate lost from
Faizabad in UP, but his wife Sucheta Kripalani defeated the
Congress candidate, Manmohini Sahgal, in Delhi.
After the votes were counted and results declared, the
first Lok Sabha or the House of the People was constituted
by the Election Commission on April 2, 1952. Until this
point, the Indian Constituent Assembly had served as an
interim legislature.

Jawaharlal Nehru became the first prime minister after
the general elections.
State Leislatures
In the state legislature elections, too, the Indian National
Congress swept the polls. The party won 2,248 seats on the
whole. It formed the government in all the states, though it
did not get the majority on its own in four states, namely,
Madras, Travancore-Cochin, Orissa and PEPSU.

Chapter 38

Developments under
Nehru’s Leadership
(1947-64)
Jawaharlal Nehru, as the first prime minister of independent
India, along with other leaders, laid the foundation of a new
India. The period between India’s independence and the death
of Nehru, in May 1964, has been often termed as ‘Nehruvian
Era’ due to Nehru’s influence on almost all aspects of
decisions taken in India during that time.
Nehru was influenced by many streams of thought,
some imported from his association with Europe and some
imbibed from his close association with Gandhi, besides what
he perceived in the nation on his tours across its regions.
As a result, he enunciated a framework of democracy
committed to secularism, socialistic approach and social
justice, besides the creation of an institutional base for
speedy development of the country not only large but marked
by huge diversity. He never forgot the idea of keeping the
country united. He tried his best to arouse in his people an
awareness of the need for social concern for the poor and
the marginalised and a respect for democratic values. Nehru
is noted for having tried to impart modern values and ways
of thinking that were adapted to Indian conditions. He was
committed to carry India into an age of scientific discovery
and technological development.
A brief survey of different events and aspects of the
Nehruvian period follows.
635

636  

Political Developments
In the first general elections in 1952, the Congress won a
huge majority and formed the government at the Centre
headed by Jawaharlal Nehru. Rajendra Prasad was elected
president by the electoral college of the first Parliament of
India.
Nehru led the Congress to major election victories in
1957 and 1962, though the winning majority was reduced
towards the end.
Parliament in this period legislated various noteworthy
laws that were directed towards social change and equity.
(These aspects are dealt with under separate headings later.)

Debate Over National Language

At the time of Independence, there were eleven major
languages in India, each spoken by more than a million
people. In colonial India, English was used as the official
language but with the attainment of independence the question
arose about having a ‘national’ or ‘official’ language, replacing
English. Gandhi had recommended the use of Hindustani as
the national language of the country for the sake of national
integration. Nehru too acknowledged the potential of
Hindustani—not too Sanskritised, not too Persianised—to
become the national language. On the whole, the idea of Hindi
as a national language was not appreciated by the non-Hindi
speaking southern and eastern regions of India. In the wake
of serious resistance, the Language Committee of Constituent
Assembly came up with a compromise formula. The Committee
decided that the Hindi in Devanagari script was to be the
‘official’ language, but transition to Hindi would be gradual.
For the first fifteen years, English would continue to be used
for all official purposes, and each province could choose one
of the regional languages, for official work within the
province, which were to be listed in the Eighth Schedule of
the Constitution. Thus, by referring to Hindi as the official
language rather than national, the committee hoped to placate
the opposition.
The language issue was further clarified by Parliament
in 1963 through the Official Languages Act which stated that
Hindi was to become the official language in India from

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 637

1965. But as a concession to the non-Hindi speakers, English
was accorded the status of ‘associate additional official
language’. Despite this, among non-Hindi speakers, especially
in south India, the resentment against Hindi continued, and
in late 1964 and in early 1965, violent demonstrations
erupted over the language issue. The Official Languages
(Amendment) Act of 1967, provided a bilingual (EnglishHindi) solution for any official communication between the
Centre and states, and gave a concession to the diverse
multiplicity of languages by recognising regional languages
in provincial administration and in public service examinations.

Linguistic Reorganisation of the States

The demand for reorganisation of the states on the basis of
language was an outcome of linguistic pluralism in India. The
demand surfaced immediately after independence. The
boundaries of provinces in pre-independent India were the
outcome of the British conquest of India. The state boundaries
were drawn either for administrative convenience or simply
coincided with the territories annexed by the British
government or the territories ruled by the princely states.
The Congress in its 1920’s session in Nagpur had made
efforts to recognise regional linguistic identities and divided
India into 21 linguistic units for its organisational set up.
Many provincial Congress committees were set up on the
basis of linguistic zones, which often did not coincide with
the administrative divisions of British India.
However, when demands for the linguistic reorganisation
of the provinces came up in the Constituent Assembly in
1946 and after independence, the national leadership under
the Congress opposed it on the ground of national unity. The
situation in the newly independent country was difficult.
India’s partition had created serious administrative, economic
and political challenges. The post-War world faced serious
economic and law and order problems. The Kashmir problem
and a war-like situation with Pakistan needed urgent attention.
However, due to continuous demands, the Constituent
Assembly, in June 1948, appointed the Linguistic Provinces
Commission, headed by Justice S.K. Dhar, to enquire into
the need of linguistic provinces. The Dhar Commission,
however, opposed such a move in the interest of national

638  

integration. Consequently the Constituent Assembly decided
not to include the linguistic principle in the constitution.
In December 1948, to pacify the vocal votaries of
linguistic states, the Congress appointed a committee (JVP),
with Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Pattabhi
Sitaramayya as its members. Its report which is known as
the JVP Report—also went against the creation of linguistic
states in the interests of national unity. There was widespread
agitation, especially in southern India, in the wake of the JVP
report.
The first demand for a linguistic province was seen in
the Telugu-speaking region of Andhra. In August 1951, Swami
Sitaram, a Congressman and Gandhian leader, started a fast
unto death. While he broke his fast after thirty-five days, the
movement was renewed in December 1952, by another
Gandhian follower, Potti Sriramulu who died after fasting for
fifty-six days. Sriramulu’s death was followed by rioting,
demonstrations, hartals and violence all over the Andhra
region. The government conceded the demand for a separate
state of Andhra, which finally came into existence on October
1, 1953 with the region being separated from the Tamil
speaking Madras state.
The creation of Andhra encouraged other linguistic
groups to intensify their movements for their own state or
for rectification of their boundaries on a linguistic ground.
Under popular pressure, Nehru government appointed the
States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) in August 1953.
The commission, comprising Justice Fazl Ali, K.M. Panikkar
and Hridaynath Kunzru as members, submitted its report in
October 1955; its recommendations were accepted with
some modifications and implemented quickly.
In November 1956, the States Reorganisation Act was
passed which provided for fourteen states and six centrally
administered territories, but many of these states still
contained sizeable linguistic minorities and regional economic
disparities. The Telangana region of Hyderabad state was
merged into Andhra, Kerala was formed by merging the
Malabar district of the old Madras Presidency with TravancoreCochin. Bombay state was enlarged further by merging the
states of Kutch and Saurashtra and the Marathi-speaking

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 639

regions of Hyderabad state. The Mysore state was enlarged
by adding Kannada-speaking areas of adjoining states—
Bombay, Madras, Hyderabad and Coorg.
As the SRC had opposed the splitting of Bombay and
Punjab, a widespread rioting broke out in January 1956 in
Bombay city. The government finally agreed in May 1960
to bifurcate the state of Bombay into Maharashtra and
Gujarat, with Bombay city being included in Maharashtra, and
Ahmedabad being made the capital of Gujarat.
The Nagas, the first to raise issue of ethnic identity,
forced the Government of India to concede to demand for
a separate state of Nagaland in 1960, inaugurated in 1963.
In an exception to the linguistic principle, in 1956, the
states of PEPSU were merged with Punjab. Punjab remained
a trilingual state having three language speakers—Punjabi,
Hindi and Pahari. The demand for a separate Punjabi Suba
(Punjabi-speaking state) assumed communal overtones because
of the Sikh and Hindu communalists. The problem remained
unsolved in Nehru’s time. It was to be addressed later by
Indira Gandhi. Over the years since then, many new states
have been formed, not necessarily along linguistic lines.

Growth of other Political Parties

Through the 1950s and 1960s the Congress party ruled at
the Centre and in most of the states. The people voted for
the Congress mainly because they saw it as the legatee of
the freedom struggle and because its leaders were perceived
to be individuals of character and integrity. Perhaps the first
time people exercised their right of choice for a party other
than the Congress was when they voted the Communists into
power in Kerala in 1957. Then, in 1963, three notable
opponents of the Congress were elected to the Lok Sabha,
namely, the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, the liberal M. R.
Masani, and the Gandhian Acharya Kripalani. All this signified
that the people of India were getting well acquainted with
the mores of democracy.
The period also saw the start and growth of political
parties other than the Congress and the Communist Party of
India and notable changes within the communist groups.
The Socialist Party
Formed in 1934 as Congress Socialist Party (SP), with its
own constitution, membership, discipline and ideology, it

640  

remained within the Congress Party till March 1948. Their
disassociation as a protest against the Congress’s move
towards the right and its growing authoritarian tendencies was
announced at a meeting in Nashik on March 28, 1948.
In September 1952, the CSP merged with the Kisan
Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP) to form a new party—Praja
Socialist Party (PSP).
Praja Socialist Party
In September 1952, the Socialist Party and the KMPP
merged to form Praja Socialist Party (PSP), with J.B.
Kripalani as the chairman and Ashoka Mehta as the general
secretary. With the merger, it became the largest opposition
party to the Congress with all India presence. But the party
could not maintain its cohesion for long.
In June 1953, at the party’s Betul conference, Ashok
Mehta called for support to the ruling party, as he believed
that in a backward country like India the crucial task was
economic development—a common challenge for all political
parties. Mehta’s thesis was rejected by the rest of the party
which accepted Rammanohar Lohia’s approach.
Lohia believed in a position of equidistance from both
the Congress and the Communists, and supported the
organisation of militant mass movements.
Lohia and his group left the PSP at the end of 1955.
While Acharya Narendra Dev died in 1956, Jayaprakash
Narayan, in 1954, announced that he would dedicate his life
to Bhoodan and other constructive activities. In 1957, after
the general elections, Jayaprakash Narayan left active politics,
declaring that party politics was not suitable for India and
campaigned for ‘partyless democracy’. Kripalani, in 1960,
left the party too, and three years later, Ashok Mehta agreed
to become the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.
Ashok Mehta joined the Congress Party with almost one-third
of PSP cadres with him.
Lohiya formed the Socialist Party which in 1964
merged with the PSP to form the Samyukta (or United)
Socialist Party (SSP). In 1965 the party split again—Lohia’s
group kept the SSP label, while his critics started a fresh
PSP.

The Communist Party
In the period following independence, the official stand taken
by the Communist Party of India towards the changing sociopolitical dynamics went through alterations. It first accepted
India’s independent foreign policy though it still considered
the government to be an agent of imperialism. It later went
on to accept India had become a sovereign republic but also
felt its policies were pro-capitalist and anti-people. The
communists would offer a ‘democratic front’ to replace the
Congress Party. In 1958, at its Amritsar meeting, the party
declared that it was possible to advance to socialism through
peaceful and parliamentary means. And, if the party came to
power, it would grant full civil liberties including the right
to oppose the socialist government and the socialist system
through constitutional mechanisms. Then, in 1961, at
Vijayawada, it was decided to follow a policy of struggle as
well as unity towards Congress—progressive policies were
to be supported while struggle against other policies were
to continue.
Split in CPI Within the party, there were several
differences on issues like attitude towards the Soviet critique
of Stalin, Russia-China ideological differences, and SinoIndia War of 1962. Some communists supported the
government fully against the Chinese invasion, while others
though opposed to the Chinese stand on the question of IndiaChina frontiers, also opposed the unqualified support to the
Nehru government because of its class character.
The Sino-Soviet ideological split also witnessed a great
deal of resonance on the Indian Communists—many
sympathetic to the Chinese position. In fact, the Chinese call
which asked the revolutionary elements in the communist
parties of the world to distance themselves from those
supporting the ‘revisionist’ soviet line, had great influence
on the Indian Communists. In 1964, the party got divided into,
CPI—representing the earlier ‘right’ and ‘centrist’ trends,
and CPM or the Communist Party (Marxist)—representing
the earlier ‘left’ trend.
The CPM believed that the Indian State was being ruled
by big bourgeoisie who collaborated with foreign finance
capital and hence have to be destroyed. They had contempt

642  

for Indian Constitution as they thought it to be antidemocratic and hence didn’t believe in peaceful and
parliamentary means. For them, an agrarian revolution coupled
with an armed struggle led by working class and the CPM
was necessary to bring changes in the social relations.
Bharatiya Jana Sangh
The Bharatiya Jan Sangh, founded on October 21, 1951, was
based on right wing ideology. According to Bipan Chandra,
the Jana Sangh was a communal party and to understand its
basic character and politics, the genesis of the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is to be analysed first. The Jan
Sangh was a creation of the RSS and drew its organised
strength, centralised character and ideological homogeneity
from it.
The party, in the beginning was strongly anti-Pakistan.
The propagation of Bharatiya culture and the establishment
of Bharatiya nationalism were its core agenda and it gave the
slogan of ‘one country one culture, one nation’. Similarly,
it took a strident stand in favour of Sanskritised Hindi as
an official link language of India. (In 1965 it gave up this
demand in view of expansion of party in non-Hindi belt and
accepted the decision to retain English along with Hindi so
long as the non-Hindi states wanted this.)
Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who had resigned from
the Nehru cabinet in April 1951 over the Liaquat-Nehru Pact,
was the main force behind the formation of the Jana Sangh.
Mukherjee claimed it to be a non-communal party aiming
to build a broad-based democratic opposition to the Congress.
But in the absence of any effective alternative ideology or
programme, and mass support, the party became a subsidiary
of the RSS. It won 3 Lok Sabha seats with 3.06 per cent
of votes. Incidentally, Mauli Chandra Sharma, the second
president of the Jana Sangh, resigned in protest against the
RSS domination of the party.
In later years, the party was to be a part of the coalition
Janata Party against the Emergency.
The Swatantra Party
Founded in August 1959, the Swatantra Party was a nonsocialist, constitutionalist and secular conservative party
having distinguished leaders like C. Rajagopalachari (who
resigned from the Congress), Minoo Masani, N.G. Ranga and

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 643

K.M. Munshi, most of them being veteran Congress leaders.
The social base of the party was narrow and consisted of:
(i) a section of industrialists and business class, discontented
with government control, quotas and licences and fearful of
nationalisation; (ii) landlords, jagirdars and princes, annoyed
due to loss of fiefdoms, social power and status, and
deteriorating economic conditions; (iii) ex-landlord-turnedcapitalist farmers and rich and middle peasants, who had
welcomed the abolition of landlordism but were fearful of
losing part of their land; and (iv) a few retired civil servants.
The Swatantra Party favoured the notion of the ‘night
watchman’ or laissez-faire State, and stood for free, private
enterprise. It opposed the active role of the State in economic
development and nationalisation of private enterprises and
extension of land reforms.
In international relations, the party denounced nonalignment as well as Indo-Soviet collaboration and wanted a
close relation with the US and countries of Western Europe.
In fact, it advocated for a defence coalition with noncommunist countries of Asia including Pakistan, under the
capitalist super power, United States.
In the 1962 elections, it won 18 seats in the Lok Sabha
and emerged as the main opposition party in four states
(Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Orissa).
Factions, defections, and death of C. Rajagopalachari
in 1967, proved detrimental to the Swatantra Party. Most of
the party leaders joined the Bharatiya Lok Dal in 1974, while
a small group led by Masani tried to survive the party.
Communal and Regional Parties
● The Hindu Mahasabha, which was founded in 1915
at Haridwar by Madan Mohan Malaviya, gradually disappeared
from the political scene after 1952 and lost its support base
to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.
● The Muslim League, owing to its association with
the demand for Pakistan, lay dormant and many of its leaders
joined the Congress Party and other parties. Later, it revived
in parts of Tamil Nadu and in Kerala and was to become
coalition partners of the Congress, CPI and CPM in coming
years.
● The Akali Dal gave way to Shiromani Akali Dal and
remained limited to Punjab.

644  
● The other regional parties which came into prominence
were—The DMK (Tamil Nadu), the Jammu and Kashmir
National conference (J & K), Jharkhand Party (in undivided
Bihar), Ganatantra Parishad (Orissa), All Parties Hill Leaders’
Conference (Assam), Scheduled Castes Federation
(Maharashtra) etc. Forward Bloc (West Bengal) and Peasants
and Workers Party (Maharashtra) were parties inclined
towards left ideology but restricted to only one state.

An Undemocratic Deed

In 1957, the Congress Party faced an unexpected defeat in
the State of Kerala when the CPI emerged as the largest
single party in the legislative assembly. E.M.S. Namboodiripad
formed the government with the support of some independents.
It was perhaps the first time that a communist government
was formed on the basis of democratic elections.
Trouble began with the introduction of the Education
Bill which was, in actuality, a progressive measure. It was
vehemently opposed by the Catholic Church in the state
which ran several educational institutions and saw the bill as
an encroachment on its power. Seeing in this situation an
apt opportunity, the local Congress party members who had
lost in the elections, organised state-wide protests. There
were strikes as well. The government resorted to lathi charges
and firing. Several persons were jailed.
Nehru, though he had little objection to the education
bill, maintained a neutral front in public. He admonished the
state government for its excessive use of force even as he
tried to rein in the Congress workers. But he failed to change
anything on the ground. In the end, he succumbed to pressure
from within and outside his party and advised the dismissal
of the EMS government and imposition of President’s Rule
in Kerala in July 1959. A democratically elected government
was thus, for the first time in independent India, dismissed
under emergency powers.

Concept of Planning for
Economic Development
Nehru believed in effective planning through the democratic
process for extensive land reforms, industrialisation, and

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 645

development of various infrastructural facilities like power
plants, transport projects, irrigation dams, etc. In his ideas
on economic development, he was not in favour of Gandhi’s
ideas. So he envisaged the State intervening in the economy,
and guiding its growth and acting directly to promote the
welfare of the population. Nehru, together with several
national leaders, were fascinated with the success of economic
planning in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s. The
genesis of the Planning Commission could be traced to the
National Planning Committee established in 1938 by
Congress, and the Bombay Plan of 1944.
The Planning Commission, an extra-constitutional
body, was set up in March 1950 by a simple resolution of
the Government of India. The body was assigned the task of
economic planning in the form of five-year plans. The prime
minister, himself, was the ex-officio chairman of the
commission. The National Development Council (NDC),
which was to give final approval to the plans, was established
on August 6, 1952.
The First Five Year Plan (1951-1956), based on
Harrod-Domar model, sought to get the nation’s economy
out of the cycle of poverty. It addressed, mainly, the agrarian
sector including investments in dams and irrigation. Huge
allocations were made for large-scale projects like the
Bhakhra Nangal Dam. It also focused on land reforms.
The Second Plan, drafted under the leadership of P.C.
Mahalanobis, stressed on heavy industries. The Plan reflected
‘socialistic pattern of society’, as the government imposed
substantial tariffs on imports in order to protect domestic
industries.
The Third Plan was not significantly different from
the Second. However, the plan strategies, according to critics,
from this time around displayed an unmistakable ‘urban bias’
as well as the industry was wrongly given priority over
agriculture.
Under the guidance of Nehru, who believed in
‘democratic socialism’, India opted for a ‘mixed economy’,
i.e., elements from the capitalist model and socialist model
were taken and mixed together. Much of the agriculture, trade
and industry were left in private hands. The State controlled

646  

key heavy industries, provided industrial infrastructure,
regulated trade and made some important interventions in
agriculture. However, a mixed model like this was open to
criticism from both the left and the right.
According to the critics, the FYPs didn’t provide the
private sector with enough space and the stimulus to grow.
Further, the systems of licenses and permits for investment
discouraged private sector and gave rise to corruption and
red tapism. On the other hand, the sympathisers of the
socialist model alleged that the State did not spend significant
amounts on public education and healthcare. The State
intervention ended up creating a new ‘middle class’ that
enjoyed the privileges of high salaries without much
accountability, according to critics.
Despite criticism of the shortfalls in plan targets, none
can deny that a solid industrial base and infrastructure
facilities were created under the plans.
Bhakhra-Nangal, Damodar Valley Corporation and
Hirakud mega-dams were constructed for irrigation and
power generation. Some of the heavy industries in the public
sector—steel plants, oil refineries, manufacturing units,
defence production, etc., were started. The Hindustan Machine
Tools, Sindri Fertiliser, Chittaranjan Rail Factory, Integral
Coach Factory, Hindustan Antibiotics, etc., proved to be of
great help to the new nation.

Progress of Science and
Technology
Nehru believed that science and technology were crucial to
the solution of India’s problems. The Scientific Policy
Resolution, acknowledging the role of science and technology
in the economic, social and cultural advancement of the
country, was passed by the Lok Sabha in March 1958. But
prior to the passing of SPR in 1958 many scientific and
technological institutes were set up in the country. To
emphasise the value of science and scientific research, Nehru
himself assumed the chairmanship of the Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research (CSIR). Some of the strides taken
in this direction, are given below.

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 647

● In January 1947, to promote self-sustaining, scientific
and technological growth, the National Physical Laboratory—
India’s first national laboratory—was set up; which was
followed by the setting up of a network of seventeen national
laboratories, focusing on different areas of research.
● In 1952, the first of the five institutes of technology,
patterned after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
was set up at Kharagpur.
● The Atomic Energy Commission, headed by Homi J.
Bhabha, was set up in August 1948. Nehru personally
encouraged Bhabha to do his best. In 1954, the government
created a separate Department of Atomic Energy with Homi
Bhabha as secretary. In August 1956, India’s first nuclear
reactor in Trombay (Asia’s first also), became critical.
● In 1962, the Indian National Committee for Space
Research (INCOSPAR), together with a Rocket Launching
Facility at Thumba (TERLS), was established.
● Steps were taken to increase India’s capacity in
production of defence equipment.
● A change over to decimal coinage and a metric system
of weights and measures, in line with international standards,
was made in phases between 1955 and 1962.

Social Developments
Developments in Education

In 1951 only 16.6 per cent of the total population was literate
and the percentage was much lower in rural areas. Between
1951 and 1961 school enrolment doubled for boys and
tripled for girls. Through the personal interest and efforts
of Nehru, several policies were introduced to improve the
educational situation. By 1964, the number of universities
increased from 18 (in 1947) to 54.
In 1949, the Indian University Education Commission,
under the chairmanship of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan was set up.
On the recommendation of the commission, the University
Grants Commission (UGC) was set up in 1953, and University
Grants Commission Act was passed in 1956.
For improvements in the secondary education, the
government appointed Mudaliar Commission in 1952, with
Dr. A. Lakshmanswami Mudaliar as chairperson. Further, to

648  

assist and advise the Central and state governments on
academic matters related to school education, the National
council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was
established in September 1961 as a literary, scientific and
charitable society.

Social Change Under Nehru

The Constitution of India ensured that Indian social organisation
underwent change, leading to the social liberation of the
hitherto socially backward and suppressed sections of society.
In 1955, the government passed the Anti-Untouchability Law,
making the practice of untouchability punishable and a
cognisable offence. The clauses mentioned in the Constitution
regarding reservations in educational institutions and
government employment in favour of weaker sections of the
society were implemented.
For women’s equal rights in the society, the Hindu
Code Bill was moved in Parliament in 1951. Despite facing
sharp opposition from conservative sections of society, the
bill was passed in the form of four separate Acts. These Acts
introduced monogamy and the right of divorce to both men
and women, raised the age of consent and marriage, and gave
women the right to maintenance and to inherit family
property. But unfortunately, in the absence of uniform civil
code, the revolutionary step benefited only Hindu women.
There was much more that needed to be done for Hindu
women too.

Foreign Policy
To pursue an independent foreign policy, for a nascent nation,
was a great challenge for the leaders of independent India.
The broad parameters which had evolved during the freedom
struggle had to be kept at the core while taking any decisions
on international affairs. Nehru gave this voice a shape in the
form of the idea of non-alignment and an organisational
structure through the non-aligned movement (NAM).
The basic principles of India’s foreign policy, during
Nehruvian Era, broadly revolved around the premises given
below.
(i) Disapproval of participation in any military alliance
either bilaterally or multilaterally.

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 649

(ii) An independent foreign policy not tied to any of
the two contending power blocs, though this was
not a synonym for a neutral foreign policy.
(iii) A policy of friendship with every country, whether
of the American bloc or of the Soviet bloc.
(iv) An active anti-colonial policy which supported
decolonisation in Asian-African-Latin American
countries.
(v) Open support to the policy of anti-apartheid.
(vi) Promotion of disarmament as the key to world
peace.
[The basic principles of non-alignment and NAM have
already been discussed at length in the chapter, ‘The Evolution
of Nationalistic Foreign Policy’.]
India’s commitment to disarmament at the international
level, could be seen in the time of framing of UN’s Charter.
Article 11 of the Charter advocates international disarmament.
India supported the formation of the Atomic Energy
Commission in 1947 and sponsored the Eighteen Nations
Disarmament Conference in 1962.

Relations with Neighbours
India and Pakistan

The unnaturalness and artificiality of partition impelled
Pakistan to try and establish its identity independent of India,
of which it was till 1947 a part by geography, history,
tradition and culture. Pakistan, since its birth, has the
aspiration for achieving parity with India in all fields. Thus,
Pakistan started competing with India at all international fora
and used all kinds of means to acquire prominence.
Kashmir Issue
Pakistan refused to accept Kashmir’s accession to India on
October 26, 1947. In response to the Pakistan-sponsored
tribal attack, India, supported by the local population under
Sheikh Abdullah, undertook a swift military action. But,
unfortunately, before the task of rescuing the territory could
be accomplished, a complaint was lodged by Nehru with the
Security Council in January 1948. This resulted in a ceasefire
on January 1, 1949. India also agreed to hold plebiscite in

650  

1947 under international supervision but due to changed
circumstances, finally withdrew from the offer in 1955.
Although diplomatic battles for Kashmir were fought in the
UNO and other international forums, no actual war took place
between the two countries upto 1964.
Indus River Water Dispute
Equitable sharing of the waters of the Indus system had been
an issue of discord since partition. The partition gave India
5 million of the 28 million acres of land irrigated by the
Indus. Most of the waters of the western parts of the Indus
system wento into the Arabian Sea. Some canals in Pakistan
depended on the eastern rivers flowing through the East
Punjab (India) for supplies. The headworks of some vital
canals in Pakistan come within the Indian territory. The
successive governments in Pakistan blamed India for any
calamity created by natural factors like droughts and floods
in Pakistan. So, under the guidance of the World Bank, an
interim agreement on canal waters was signed on April 17,
1959. Subsequently, a comprehensive agreement between the
two countries, was signed on September 19, 1960 in Karachi.
Unfortunately, till today, on several occasions, the Indus
Water Treaty has caused discord between two nations.

India and China

One of the first countries with which independent India
established diplomatic relations was the Nationalist
Government of China led by Chiang Kaishek. When the
Nationalist Government was overthrown by the Communists
in 1949, India was once more among the first countries to
recognise the new government led by Mao Tse Tung. India
consistently supported the efforts of the People’s Republic
of China to get admitted to the United Nations. But the
results of all these efforts proved frustrating for India.
Developments in Tibet and Panchsheel
The Chinese army entered Tibet in 1950 and occupied it.
India, apart from sharing about 2000 miles of frontier in the
Tibet region, had inherited several rights and obligations over
Tibet from the British rule. However, to maintain peace,
Nehru in 1954 concluded an agreement with China, which
formalised the Chinese occupation of Tibet. The agreement
is popularly known as Panchsheel.

Developments under Nehru’s Leadership (1947-64)

 651

In 1959, a popular uprising took place in Tibet against
Chinese dominance. Though the upsurge was suppressed by
China, the religious head of Tibet, Dalai Lama fled and took
asylum in India. Taking this as an excuse, China in 1959
occupied Longju and 12,000 square miles of Indian territory
in Ladakh. This followed a series of protest notes,
memorandums and aide memoires being exchanged between
the two countries. In the next move, China laid claims on
large parts of Indian territories, after which the Chinese
prime minister, Chou-En-Lai came to New Delhi in April
1960 to negotiate border disputes. Official teams of the two
countries also visited each other, but no agreement could be
reached and the border dispute continued.
Sino-Indian War, 1962
In October 1962, China attacked India in NEFA (Arunachal
Pradesh) and Ladakh. Thus, a war between the two countries
started, which ended in a military debacle for India. The
Chinese had a geographical advantage as well as superior
arms. Nehru turned to the USA and Britain for help. The
Western powers—the USA as well as Britain—pledged
support to India and were already flying arms to India. In
November 1962, China made a unilateral declaration of its
withdrawal. But China continued its occupation of a large
chunk of Ladakh—a much coveted strategic link between Sin
Kiang and southern China.
India’s diplomatic efforts to pressurise China to return
the territories yielded no results. Even the Afro-Asian
mediation by Indonesia, Cambodia, Burma, UAR, Ghana and
Ceylon to find a peaceful solution of Sino-Indian border
dispute, at Colombo in December 1962, failed to get a
favourable response from China. In 1964, China tested its
first nuclear explosion, further alarming India.
Consequences of Sino-Indian War
(i) The war gave a big blow to the self-respect of India.
(ii) The policy of non-alignment came under question.
(iii) The Congress lost three parliamentary by-elections in
a row and Nehru had to face the first no-confidence
motion of his life.
(iv) The Third Five-Year Plan was badly affected as
resources were diverted for defence.

652  

(v) India’s foreign policy took a change, as the US and
the UK had responded positively in the crisis, they
were to be considered in future. US intelligence
agencies developed links in the name of countering
the Chinese threat and even planted a nuclear-powered
device in the Himalayas.
(vi) Pakistan, encouraged by the Indian debacle in the war,
was to attack India in 1965, covertly helped by China.

India and Nepal

The geographical location of Nepal has made it inseparable
from India from the point of view of India’s external security.
Being conscious of this factor, India signed a treaty with
Nepal in July 1950 by which it recognised Nepal’s sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence. The two countries
made a commitment to each other to inform each other of
any serious friction or misunderstanding arising on any
problem.

India and Bhutan

In August 1949, the two countries signed a treaty for
perpetual peace and friendship. India undertook to exercise
non-interference in the internal administration of Bhutan,
while Bhutan agreed to be guided by the advice of government
of India in regard to its external relations.

India and Sri Lanka

The Tamil-Sinhalese riots of 1958 and thereafter attracted
the sympathy of some Indian leaders for the Tamilian
population of Sri Lanka. This open sympathy, inside and
outside Indian Parliament, was disliked by the Sri Lankan
government. But the Indian government, considering the
ethnic disputes in Sri Lanka to be an internal matter of that
country, remained friendly towards Sri Lanka. Both nations
forged mutually beneficient economic and trade relations. In
fact, Sri Lanka supported NAM and did not join any military
alliance.

Chapter 39


Towards the last years of Nehru’s prime ministership itself,
there were serious debates on what would happen to India
after him. And when he died in May 1964, many in India
and abroad were almost sure that the Indian political system
would be severely and adversely affected, could even collapse,
with a fight within the Congress party over who would take
charge. However, there was no such turmoil; a smooth
succession took place. Indeed, since the Nehruvian era, India
has seen not only several prime ministers but also certain
changes in its political history. Down the years there have
been some upheavals to threaten the smooth functioning of
a vibrant democracy, but these challenges have been met and
overcome. Amidst the coups and military takeovers in the
neighbouring countries, India has managed to survive as a
democracy and witness smooth change of government from
time to time though democratic elections.
Immediately after Nehru’s death, Gulzarilal Nanda was
appointed as the interim prime minister, pending the election
of a new parliamentary leader of the Congress party who
would then become prime minister.

The Lal Bahadur Shastri Years
(June 1964 – January 1966)
It is generally accepted that a group within the Congress,
formed in 1963, which came to be known as the Syndicate
and included the president of the party, K. Kamaraj, and some
653

654  

others, guided the succession to the prime minister’s post
after Jawaharlal Nehru. The choice was between Morarji
Desai and Lal Bahadur Shastri. The former was the senior
and experienced Congressman who was known for his
administrative skills and honesty but also considered to be
conservative, somewhat rigid and leaning towards the ‘right’;
the latter was seen to be mild, soft-spoken and flexible even
though a man of integrity and of incorruptible nature. Shastri
was supported more widely across the party than was Desai.
In the end, Shastri was chosen by the party as the next
parliamentary leader, hence the prime minister, as Desai
decided not to contest.

Early Life

Lal Bahadur Shastri was born on October 2, 1904, in Uttar
Pradesh (known as United Provinces at the time). Firmly
opposed to the caste system, he decided to leave out his
surname of Srivastava. ‘Shastri’ was a title he got on
completing his graduation at Kashi Vidyapeeth, Varanasi, in
1928. When he married Lalita Devi in 1928, Lal Bahadur
Shastri, very much opposed to the idea of dowry, is said to
have accepted just five yards of khadi and a spinning wheel
on the insistence of his father-in-law to accept something.
Swayed by Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri joined
the freedom movement; in the Non-cooperation Movement
of 1921 he was arrested for taking part in a demonstration
but, as he was then a minor, he was let off. Later he was
part of the major movements of the struggle against the
British rule, such as the Salt Stayagraha and the individual
satyagraha movement and then in the 1942 Quit India
Movement. Imprisoned several times, he made use of his
time in prison reading the works of the social reformers and
western philosophers.
Shastri was very much part of the Congress political
organisation, becoming the secretary of the local unit of the
party and later the president of the Allahabad Congress
Committee. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of
the United Provinces in 1937.

Political Journey after Independence

After independence, Shastri became a minister in Uttar
Pradesh state, in charge of the Police and Transport portfolio



 655

in Govind Ballabh Pant’s cabinet. Among his initiatives in
that position were the appointment of women as bus
conductors, and a direction to the police that water jets be
used instead of lathis to disperse unruly mobs.
Shastri was made the General Secretary of the All-India
Congress Committee, with Jawaharlal Nehru as the President,
in 1951. The same year he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha.
Nehru drew him into the union cabinet. Shastri was the
railways minister, though he resigned in 1956, taking moral
responsibility for a serious rail accident. But he was soon
drawn back into the cabinet, and in 1961, he was appointed
home minister; in this capacity he achieved a reputation of
being a skilful mediator, and he also formed the Committee
on Prevention of Corruption headed by K. Santhanam – on
the basis of whose recommendations the Central Vigilance
Commission was established. He had also been Minister for
Transport and Communications; Minister for Commerce and
Industry; and, during Nehru’s illness, Minister without
Portfolio.
Prime Minister: Continuing Nehru’s Legacy but
with Change
Lal Bahadur Shastri was sworn in as the second prime
minister of India on June 9, 1964. He kept with himself the
portfolios of external affairs and atomic energy, though he
later transferred the external affairs ministry to Swaran Singh.
In his first broadcast to the nation as prime minister,
Shastri said: “There comes a time in the life of every nation
when it stands at the cross-roads of history and must choose
which way to go. But for us there need be no difficulty or
hesitation, no looking to right or left. Our way is straight
and clear – the building up of a socialist democracy at home
with freedom and prosperity for all, and the maintenance of
world peace and friendship with all nations.”
A true secularist at heart, Shastri said: “The unique thing
about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians,
Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have
temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do
not bring all this into politics. This is the difference between
India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be
an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we

656  

Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may
choose, and worship in any way we please. So far as politics
is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.”
As prime minister, Shastri retained the main ministers
of Nehru’s cabinet, but also drew Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s
daughter, into his cabinet as information and broadcasting
minister. He respected Nehru and kept true to the general
policies created by the first prime minister of India, but he
was not a blind follower of Nehru. In several ways, he showed
he had a mind of his own.
Shastri was the first prime minister to have a secretary
to the prime minister when he drew upon L.K. Jha, a senior
ICS officer, to advise him. He thus laid the foundation of
what later took the form of the Prime Minister’s Secretariat
or the Prime Minister’s Office.
Challenges
Shastri’s short tenure saw some major developments. It also
showed that Shastri was no weakling but had a vision of his
own besides being capable of taking tough decisions quickly.
He said: “Perhaps due to my being small in size and soft
of tongue, people are apt to believe that I am not able to
be very firm. Though not physically strong, I think I am
internally not so weak.” The three major crises that his
government faced were the violent anti-Hindi demonstrations
in the state of Madras (later to be named Tamil Nadu), the
widespread food shortages, and the second war with Pakistan.
The country was disturbed in 1965 by major protests
in the non-Hindi speaking states against the possibility of
Hindi being imposed as the only national language of India.
The agitation was especially intense and violent in Madras
state. There were agitations by students and even riots in
some places over the issue. Shastri brought peace to prevail
by assuring the people that English would continue to be used
as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states
wanted, though the army had to be called in to quell riots
in some places.

Economic Ideas

Though few people seem to have realised it, Lal Bahadur
Shastri took some important steps to meet the challenges



 657

that faced the country, steps that were very different from
Nehruvian economics.
A Forerunner of Economic Reform
Not many seem to know that Shastri tried to decentralise
governance by moving decision-making on projects from the
Planning Commission to the ministries dealing with economic
subjects. Indeed, there was an attempt to reduce the dominance
of the Planning Commission by the setting up of a national
planning council. In 1965, Shastri announced in Parliament
that there would be a reconsideration of government controls
over the economic activities; consequently, there was a
relaxation in regulations for some sectors, such as steel and
cement. Shastri’s economic team comprised people like L.K.
Jha, I.G. Patel, Dharma Vira and S. Bhoothalingam who were
tilted towards reforming the economy through modernising
agriculture and allowing more private sector freedom. Even
the decision to devalue the rupee was taken in principle by
Shastri though the actual step was implemented by Indira
Gandhi. Unfortunately, Shastri died before effective steps
could be taken in all the fields. If he had lived longer, it
is possible, as P.N. Dhar says, that Shastri might have pursued
“an agenda of economic reform of the kind that was taken
up only twenty-five years later” (under the prime ministership
of Narasimha Rao).
The slogan that he gave India during the war with
Pakistan aptly reflected his view: “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan”
showed Shastri’s firm belief that the security of the nation
upheld by the soldier was closely linked with food security,
Views
He (Shastri) wore no ideological blinkers; he saw facts as they
were in all their starkness. Chronic food shortages made him
sift from basic industries to agriculture. Roaring black markets
persuaded him to make relative shift from controls to incentives,
and the glaring inefficiency of the public sector made him accept
a larger role for the private sector and foreign investment. He
also took measures to shift the locus of economic decisionmaking from the Planning Commission to the ministries and from
the Centre to the states.

food production that was the farmer’s forte. The slogan
implied that the farmers’ work on the field was equivalent
to the soldier’s action on the battlefield in the service of
the nation.
The Seeds of Green Revolution and White Revolution
India faced a food shortage and things were in a bad shape
when Shastri drew in C. Subramaniam as his food and
agriculture minister. Shastri gave full support to his minister
in laying the foundations of the Green Revolution, although
it was Indira Gandhi who is usually given the credit, as the
gains of the new methods came to be seen only after about
a decade. But in fact, it was the result of Shastri’s initiatives
to transform Indian agriculture.
The Green Revolution involved a threefold thrust–
technological, economic and organisational. The Indian Council
of Agricultural Research was reorganised and, for the first
time, a scientist, Dr B.P. Pal, was appointed as its head. M.S.
Swaminathan of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute
brought the government to an awareness of the new highyielding wheat varieties developed by Norman Borlaug’s team
in Mexico and how India must launch field demonstrations.
In the face of opposition from various quarters, including the
Congress party, Shastri approved the import of 250 tonnes
of wheat seeds in 1965. Later in 1966 some many thousands
of tonnes were to be imported. And the Green Revolution
in wheat was set in motion, as Indian scientists improved upon
these varieties. In November 1965, when C.S. Subramaniam
and Orville Freeman, the US agriculture secretary, met in
Rome, they signed an accord that put on paper what had
already been launched with the support of Shastri. As per the
accord, India was committed to end imports of food grains
by 1971 by investing more in agriculture, irrigation, research,
seeds, fertilisers and put in place suitable economic and
marketing policies. The Americans, for their part, agreed to
send more wheat to India in 1965 and 1966.
Incentives to support the new technology were also put
in place. The Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) and the
Food Corporation of India (FCI) came into being in January
1965. The National Seeds Corporation and the Central
Warehousing Corporation were also set up around this time.



 659

Shastri was also instrumental in setting in motion the
White Revolution – a national campaign to raise the production
and supply of milk. On his visit to Anand in Gujarat in
October 1964 to inaugurate the Cattle Feed Factory of Amul
at Kanjari, he was impressed by the milk cooperative. He
wished that Verghese Kurien, who was the General Manager
of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd
(Amul) at the time, would help in creating such cooperatives
in other parts of the country so as to improve the conditions
of farmers. The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)
was established, as a consequence, at Anand in 1965.
Skip a Meal Idea
The chronic food shortage in the country was a worrying fact.
Also, during the 1965 war with Pakistan, Lyndon B. Johnson,
the then President of the U.S., tried to put pressure on India
by warning that if India did not stop the war the U. S. would
stop providing wheat to the country under the PL-480
agreement. (India needed to import wheat at that time to meet
its food grains requirement.) Shastri refused to be budged.
“We may go hungry, but not bow before the US,” he told
the Indians.
Shastri motivated the people to voluntarily give up one
meal a week so that food could be saved to be distributed
to the people who required it. However, before asking the
public to do so he got his family members to first try the
system. Surprisingly, the public response was huge with even
restaurants closing down on Monday evenings.
New Institutions and Projects
Several new institutions were inaugurated during Shastri’s
tenure. Some of these were the Central Institute of Technology
Campus at Tharamani, Chennai, in November 1964; the
Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University at Hyderabad in
March 1965 (renamed Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural
University in 1996, and separated into two universities after
formation Telangana State, with the university in Telangana
being named in July 2014 as Professor Jayashanker
Agricultural University); and the National Institute of
Technology, Allahabad.
The Jawahar Dock of the Chennai Port Trust was

660  

inaugurated by Shastri, and the construction work of Tuticorin
Port was begun in November 1964.
The foundation stone for the Upper Krishna Project,
of which the Alamatti dam is a part, was laid by Shastri in
1964. (It was decided by the government to name the Almatti
Dam after Lal Bahadur Shastri.)
It was Shastri who inaugurated the plutonium
reprocessing plant at Trombay in 1965. This followed the
suggestion by Dr. Homi Bhabha that India should develop
nuclear explosives for peaceful purposes, an idea which
Shastri endorsed. At the initiative of Homi Bhabha, the
nuclear explosive design group Study of Nuclear Explosions
for Peaceful Purposes (SNEPP) was set up.

Foreign Relations

Shastri made no basic changes in the policy of non-alignment.
However, he was deeply conscious that, in the wake of India’s
war with China (1962) and the growth of military ties
between Pakistan and the People’s Republic of China, the
Indian government should increase the defence budget of the
country. So he tried to modernise the armed forces of India.
He also decided that India should build closer ties with the
Soviet Union.
He made overtures to neighbouring states to solve
outstanding problems. The Bandarnaike-Shastri accord of
1964 between India and Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was then called)
was signed by Lal Bahadur Shastri and his Ceylonese
counterpart, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Concerned with the
status of Indian Tamils in Ceylon, the pact settled for the
repatriation of 6,00,000 Indian Tamils to India and Ceylonese
citizenship to be granted to 3,75, 000 Tamils in Ceylon –
to be accomplished by 1981. Shastri, however, died soon
after, and the accord was not fulfilled, and some years later
India considered the agreement to have lapsed.
Burma had undergone a military coup in 1962, and
following that many Indian families settled there had been
repatriated by the Burmese government in 1964. Relations
between India and Burma were strained. However, Shastri
made an official visit to Rangoon in December 1965, and
cordial relations were again established between India and the
Burmese government under General Ne Win.



 661

Considering the situation in the subcontinent and the
disturbed relations with Pakistan and China, Lal Bahadur
Shastri did not hesitate to initiate a nuclear explosives
programme. In 1965, he gave authorisation to the Atomic
Energy Commission to work on achieving a nuclear test. He
faced strong opposition on this issue from his own government
and party as well as others, but he did not waver. Unfortunately,
Lal Bahadur Shastri died in January 1966 as did the prominent
personality on the nuclear science programme in India, Homi
J. Bhabha, before the programme could proceed.

The Indo-Pak War

In 1965, India faced threats of war from Pakistan. General
Mohammad Ayub Khan had come to power in Pakistan
through a military coup in 1958, forcibly taking over from
President Iskander Mirza and assuming the president’s post
himself. The US was giving Pakistan a great deal of military
support. The war with China in 1962 had left the Indians,
including the armed forces, feeling demoralised. So Ayub
Khan probably thought it was the right time to test the
strength of the Indian forces at the frontier. In April 1965,
Pakistan tested the situation in Sindh. It seemed as if the
Pakistanis could win after the first clashes in the Rann of
Kachchh. Both sides were, at Britain’s intervention, made to
agree to a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces to the positions
held before the clashes. Confident that the Indian army was
weak, and trying to capitalise on the unrest created in the
valley by the followers of Sheikh Abdullah and some other
dissidents, the leadership in Pakistan decided to launch an
attack in Kashmir. ‘Operation Grandslam’ was launched in
August with the idea of using the only significant overland
route to Kashmir before India could muster its forces and
outmoded tanks. Pakistan’s foreign minister at the time,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, encouraged Ayub Khan in this venture.
Well-trained infiltrators were sent into the valley with the
idea of creating an uprising there.
The Indian prime minister showed his strength of mind
at this point of time. Pakistan claimed that there was a
spontaneous uprising against the Indian occupation of Kashmir.
India pointed out that Pakistan had instigated trouble inside

662  

Indian territory by sending armed raiders into Jammu and
Kashmir from so-called ‘Azad Kashmir’ (Pakistan-occupied
Kashmir). Declaring tht force would be met with force,
Shastri gave orders that the Indian army should cross the
ceasefire line and close the passes used by the infiltrators.
By early September the second Indo-Pakistan war had begun.
Shastri proved that he could be decisive in a way that Nehru
had not been. He took little time to grant the Indian forces
the permission to take the needed retaliatory steps. His
defence minister, Y.B. Chavan, also proved to be outstanding.
In September, Indian forces launched a three-pronged
attack with their tanks aiming at Lahore and Sialkot across
the border in Punjab. Soon, Lahore was within the range of
Indian fire. It was also the first time that the Indian Air Force
was to take part in war after independence.
The United Nations intervened and a ceasefire was
brokered to which both sides agreed on September 23.
Peace Agreement at Tashkent
A South Asian peace conference was held in January 1966
at Tashkent (the capital of Uzbekistan, then one of the
republics of the Soviet Union) which was sponsored by the
Soviet President, Alexei Kosygin. It was with the mediation
of Kosygin that President Ayub Khan of Pakistan and Prime
Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri of India met and signed the
Tashkent Declaration on January 10, 1966 to “restore normal
and peaceful relations between their countries and to promote
understanding and friendly relations between their peoples”.
The Tashkent Declaration was meant to form a
framework for lasting peace between India and Pakistan. It
is believed that the two sides were not able to reach an
agreement on their own and that they were compelled by the
Soviet leaders to sign a draft that they had prepared. However,
it did not meet with complete approval in India. Critics felt
that the agreement should have but did not include a no-war
pact, nor was there any provision that Pakistan should give
up guerrilla aggression in Kashmir. In Pakistan, the agreement
was received even more angrily: there were riots and
demonstrations against it. Zulfikar Bhutto distanced himself
from Ayub Khan and the pact, and in the end broke away
to subsequently form his own political party.



 663

The Tashkent Declaration
The points of the Tashkent Declaration signed by President Ayub
Khan of Pakistan and Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri of India
that was directed towards bringing peace after the September war
are as follows.
1. Both sides will exert all efforts to create good neighbourly
relations between India and Pakistan in accordance with the
United Nations Charter. They reaffirm their obligation under the
Charter not to have recourse to force and to settle their
disputes through peaceful means. They considered that the
interests of peace in their region and particularly in the IndoPakistan Sub-Continent and, indeed, the interests of the
peoples of India and Pakistan were not served by the
continuance of tension between the two countries. It was
against this background that Jammu and Kashmir was
discussed, and each of the sides set forth its respective
position.
2. All armed personnel of the two countries shall be withdrawn
not later than 25 February, 1966 to the positions they held
prior to 5 August, 1965, and both sides shall observe the
cease-fire terms on the cease-fire line.
3. Relations between India and Pakistan shall be based on the
principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of each other.
4. Both sides will discourage any propaganda directed against
the other country, and will encourage propaganda which
promotes the development of friendly relations between the two
countries.
5. The High Commissioner of India to Pakistan and the High
Commissioner of Pakistan to India will return to their posts
and that the normal functioning of diplomatic missions of both
countries will be restored. Both Governments shall observe the
Vienna Convention of 1961 on Diplomatic Intercourse.
6. Measures will be considered towards the restoration of
economic and trade relations, communications, as well as
cultural exchanges between India and Pakistan, and to take
measures to implement the existing agreements between India
and Pakistan.
7. The two leaders would give instructions to their respective
authorities to carry out the repatriation of the prisoners of war.
8. Both sides will continue the discussion of questions relating
to the problems of refugees and evictions/illegal immigrations.
Both sides will create conditions which will prevent the exodus
of people. The return of the property and assets taken over

664  
by either side in connection with the conflict would be
discussed.
9. Both sides will continue meetings both at the highest and at
other levels on matters of direct concern to both countries.
Both sides have recognised the need to set up joint IndianPakistani bodies which will report to their governments in order
to decide what further steps should be taken.

Shastri’s Death

Early in the morning of January 11, 1965, the morning
following the signing of the Tashkent Declaration, Lal
Bahadur Shastri died of a heart attack. There was a controversy
over the death, with rumours floating that Shastri had been
poisoned. The hand of the Central Intelligence Agency (of
the USA) has been suspected in the matter (as also in
engineering the death of Homi Bhabha in an air crash) as
the West was wary of the nuclear aspirations of India and
a disturbance in the balance of power in South Asia. The
controversy has still not ended, especially as RTIs asking for
relevant information have been turned down by the government.

Indira Gandhi: the First Phase
(January 1966 to March 1977)
After the sudden and unexpected death of Lal Bahadur Shastri
in January 1966, once again, Gulzarilal Nanda was appointed
the interim prime minister pending elections. Morarji Desai
was a contender for the post of the Congress party
parliamentary leader and, as a corollary, the prime minister.
The Syndicate supported Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s daughter, and
most party members also were in favour of her. She won
the election; it is said most of the senior Congressmen
supported her as they thought she was weak enough to be
manipulated as they wanted. Time was to prove them wrong.

Early Life

Indira Priyadarshini was born on November 19, 1917 in
Allahabad to Jawaharlal Nehru and Kamala Nehru. India was
in the midst of a struggle for freedom from the British and
the Nehru family was fully involved in the struggle. So,



 665

almost from childhood, Indira was closely in touch with the
events of those days of turmoil.
It is reported that when bonfires of foreign goods were
made during the freedom movement, Indira, then a child, gave
up a doll made in England to be thrown into the fire. At the
age of twelve, she brought together and led a group of
children – calling it the Vanar Sena – to do their bit for the
freedom struggle. These youngsters addressed envelopes,
made flags, helped put up nptices and carried messages to
the freedom fighters.
Indira attended several schools and colleges, sometimes
just for brief periods: these included the Ecole de Bex in
Switzerland, Rabindranath Tagore’s Visva-Bharati university
at Santiniketan, Bengal, and Somerville College, Oxford,
U.K., among others.
In 1936 Indira joined the Indian National Congress, and
in 1938 she became a member of the India League. It was
during her stay in England that she met Feroze Jehangir
Ghandy (later changed to Gandhi), who was also a member
of the India League and studying in London. Feroze was a
Parsi. Indira returned to India in 1941 with Feroze Gandhi,
and she married him in 1942. Feroze too was a member of
the Indian National Congress and took part in the freedom
struggle. Indira was an active participant in the Quit India
movement and was imprisoned in Naini Central Jail for some
time. Feroze and Indira had two sons – Rajiv and Sanjay –
both of whom were later to be part of India’s political scene
in their different ways.

Political Journey after Independence

After independence, when the Congress party came to power
and Jawaharlal Nehru became the country’s prime minister,
Indira often acted as her father’s hostess for events and
accompanied him on his travels. In the 1951-52 General
Elections, Indira Gandhi handled the campaigns of Feroze,
who was contesting from Rae Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.
Feroze was elected to the Lok Sabha. But they had differences
in personal life and soon separated. Feroze soon became a
major spokesman against the corruption in the government.
He was instrumental in exposing a scam involving major

666  

insurance companies and the finance minister in Nehru’s
cabinet, T.T. Krishnamachari. He died in September 1960.
Indira joined the Congress party’s working committee
in 1955, and in 1959 she was elected the party’s president.
Following the death of her father in 1964, she became a
member of the Rajya Sabha and was inducted into the cabinet
by Lal Bahadur Shastri as the information and broadcasting
minister.
Prime Minister
On January 19, 1966, Indira Gandhi became the third prime
minister of India – the first woman to occupy the post in the
country.
The General Elections of 1967 came amidst economic
problems—stagnation and food crisis, rising prices,
unemployment—which caused much disenchantment among
the people. The decision on devaluation of the rupee was
criticised by many. Also political disputes obstructed the
import of wheat from the US. In the 1967 General Elections,
Indira Gandhi won the Lok Sabha seat from Rae Bareilly. The
Congress party managed to win the elections but managed
only a thin majority in the Lok Sabha. Indira Gandhi was now
prime minister but also had Morarji Desai as deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
The Congress either lost power or failed to get a
majority in several states in the assembly elections. The
coalition governments that took power in many states,
however, led to unstable governments and the practice of
defections from party to party.
Congress Split and Minority Government at the
Centre
In the following years, there was much turmoil within the
Congress party. So far the Congress party had been
accommodative of diverse interests. There was now a growing
divide in ideology between the right and the left. The
Congress right was in favour of tackling the protest movements
and putting down the left, giving more space to the private
sector in the economy and improving relations with the US.
Indira Gandhi did not agree with many of the ideas of the
senior leaders of the party. She was in favour of radical



 667

economic reform which did not meet the approval of the
conservative senior members of the party. A ten-point
programme adopted by the Congress Working Committee
under Indira Gandhi’s aegis referred to the need for social
control of banks, the government taking up foreign trade,
nationalisation of general insurance, ceilings on property,
public distribution of food grains, accelerated implementation
of land reforms, provision of subsidised plots for housing
the rural poor, etc. Indira Gandhi was in favour of abolishing
the privy purses to former rulers of the princely states. Her
decision to nationalise a set of banks without consulting her
finance minister was not approved by the senior party
members. In the end, Morarji Desai was forced to resign
from the cabinet.
With the death of President Zakir Hussain in May 1969,
things came to a head; there were strong differences over
the choice of candidates for the election to the post of
President of India. The official Congress candidate was
Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, a member of the Syndicate, but Indira
Gandhi, now increasingly leaning towards socialistic ideology,
and fearing that the Syndicate would use Sanjiva Reddy to
get her out of power, was in favour of V.V. Giri (erstwhile
vice-president now standing as an independent candidate).
V.V. Giri won the election and became the President of India
in August 1969.
Consequently, in November, the Congress party
president, S. Nijalingappa, expelled Indira Gandhi from the
party on ground of indiscipline. India Gandhi managed to win
over a majority of the party members to her side and created
her own faction, the Congress (R) where R stood for
‘Requisitionists’, in 1969 while the other group was the
Congress (O) with O for ‘Organisation’ headed by Ram
Subhag Singh. Indira Gandhi no longer had a majority in the
Lok Sabha but, with the issue-based support of regional
parties such as the DMK, the Akali Dal and the two
communist parties, she retained power at the Centre.
The 1971 Elections: Indira Triumphant
Indira Gandhi found she could not take independent action
as head of a minority government. Her efforts at progressive

668  

legislations were obstructed by the Supreme Court as well
as the Parliament. She got the nationalisation of banks
through a presidential ordinance after clearing the legal
lacunae pointed out by the court. The abolition of privy purses
not only failed to get passed in Parliament (the constitutional
amendment fell through just by one vote in the Rajya Sabha),
but the presidential order derecognising the princes that
Indira Gandhi brought in was nullified by the Supreme Court.
In December 1970, Indira Gandhi recommended dissolution
of the Lok Sabha and called for early elections. The nation
thus went to the polls in 1971. The catchy slogan of the
Congress (R) was ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty). Indira
Gandhi campaigned for social change and removal of
disparities in income and for stability of government.
The non-Communist opposition parties (Swatantra,
Congress-O, SSP) came together in what was called the
Grand Alliance with the election cry of ‘Indira Hatao’
(Remove Indira).
Congress (R) won the election with a good majority,
probably because the voters showed maturity in preferring
to vote on national issues rather than fall prey to political
patronage. Indira Gandhi was now well on her way to
dominating the political scene for a long time to come.
India’s victory over Pakistan in December 1971 and the
subsequent creation of independent Bangladesh out of the
erstwhile East Pakistan in the liberation war gave a big boost
to the image of Indira Gandhi. In the state assembly elections
in March 1972 the Congress (R) came to power in many
states. The elections of 1971 and 1972 had virtually reduced
the importance of the Congress (O) and the Swatantra Party
as significant opponents.
Problems
The huge enthusiasm for Indira Gandhi, however, started
fading by 1973, in spite of some important achievements of
the government. Economic problems grew. The main issue
was high inflation that followed from the war time expenses,
drought in some parts of the country and the oil crisis of
1973. Food grains production declined due to poor monsoons,
and low agricultural growth had its adverse impact on industry



 669

as well. As world crude prices soared, India was affected by
high costs of import and the resulting high prices of
petroleum products. Unemployment grew. There were strikes,
the most notable one being the all-India railway strike in May
1974. Most the influential social classes got gradually
alienated from Indira Gandhi – the rich peasants resented land
reforms, the industrialists resented the wide scale
nationalisation and socialistic policies, and the middle classes
were deeply affected by the price rise and were critical of
the spreading corruption among officials and politicians. The
fact that Sanjay Gandhi, Indira Gandhi’s second son, was
entrusted with the venture of producing a small fuel efficient
Indian car and was handed the contract and the exclusive
production licence, though he had little experience in the
field, was seen by most people as nepotism.
The JP Movement
There were protest movements in many places, especially in
Gujarat and Bihar, against the rising prices of essential
commodities.
The Nav Nirman movement in Gujarat between
December 1973 and March 1974 was serious enough for the
central government to decide to dissolve the assembly in the
state. The chief minister, Chimanbhai Patel, had to resign,
and the Centre promulgated president’s rule over Gujarat.
The movement in Bihar began as a series of student
protests, but it was soon taken up by Jayaprakash Narayan
(popularly known as JP) on a larger issue of corruption in
high places. JP called for ‘Total Revolution’ against the very
system that he said had forced people to become corrupt.
He demanded that the Congress government in Bihar resign
and the assembly be dissolved. People were asked to gherao
the legislature and offices and refuse to pay taxes – in other
words, obstruct government functioning. Jayaprakash Narayan
went beyond Bihar to try and draw the rest of the country
into the protest with the aim of bringing down Indira Gandhi’s
government which was portrayed as corrupt and undemocratic.
People in many parts of North India were enthused by JP’s
call; besides, the non-left opposition parties rallied behind
him. The movement, however, lost momentum by the end of

670  

1974. Indira Gandhi challenged Jayaprakash Narayan to test
the strength of his group against the Congress in the 1976
elections and JP accepted the challenge. However, before the
‘contest’ could be settled democratically, things changed
drastically.
The Allahabad High Court Decision and the
Imposition of Emergency
On June 12, 1975, Justice Sinha of the Allahabad High Court
delivered a verdict in an election petition filed by Raj Narain,
Indira Gandhi’s opponent in the Rae Bareilly contest in 1971;
Raj Narain had accused Indira Gandhi of corrupt practices
during her election campaign. The court verdict declared
Indira Gandhi’s election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 invalid
on grounds of electoral malpractice, excessive election
expenditure, and using government machinery and officials
for party purposes; this meant that she could no longer be
the prime minister and could not try for election to Parliament
for six years.
An appeal against the judgement was made in the
Supreme Court but before that could be settled other events
took place. For one, in the Gujarat assembly elections the
Congress party suffered reverses and could not form a
government. The JP movement was revived with greater zeal
and the demand grew for Indira Gandhi’s resignation. There
was a call for nationwide agitation and an announcement was
made that a civil disobedience would begin on June 29.
Indira Gandhi responded by recommending to President
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed that a state of internal emergency
should be declared all over the country because of the
lawlessness. The president, accordingly, declared a State of
Emergency due to internal disorder, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on June 2526, 1975. (The prime minister’s decision had not yet been
endorsed by the cabinet, the cabinet could agree to it only
after the event.)
State of Emergency (1975–1977)
“The President has proclaimed the Emergency. This is
nothing to panic about. I am sure you are all aware of the
deep and widespread conspiracy, which has been brewing ever



 671

Indira Gandhi and JP—
Both to be Blamed?
The agitation led by JP was getting increasingly chaotic and
certainly posed issues of law and order for the government. JP
even exhorted the Army and the police not to obey ‘illegal’ orders.
When the Allahabad Court judgement came, the cry for Indira
Gandhi’s resignation/removal became strident.
Indira Gandhi’s appeal to the Supreme Court led to an interim
decision by the vacation judge, Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, who,
on June 24, allowed a conditional stay of the Allahabad verdict
– that Indira Gandhi could remain in her post, speak in Parliament
but could not vote in it. This stay order reinforced the demand
of JP and the Janata Morcha for the removal of Indira Gandhi
as the prime minister.
JP seems to have forgotten the Gandhian principles on
which he had been nurtured. He could have had the patience to
wait for the general elections which were due in March 1976: if
people were dissatisfied they would have thrown out Indira Gandhi
and the Congress. But JP and his allies were not even willing
to abide by the Supreme Court judgement and wait for the final
decision.
In her broadcast to the nation on the evening of June 26,
1975, Indira Gandhi said: “In the name of democracy it has been
sought to negate the very functioning of democracy, duly elected
governments have not been allowed to function… agitations have
surcharged the atmosphere, leading to violent incidents… certain
persons have gone to the length of inciting our armed forces to
mutiny and our police to rebel… How can any government worth
the name stand by and allow the country’s stability to be
imperilled?”
Indira Gandhi, for her part, seems to have forgotten or
deliberately discarded her father’s democratic ideals. But then,
perhaps, she was always a little autocratic; she was after all
instrumental in getting an elected Communist government in Kerala
dismissed. After the Allahabad Court judgement, she could have
gracefully resigned, dissolved the Lok Sabha and called for early
general elections or waited a few months on the side lines for
the elections on their due date. But she was not interested in
giving up power: she claimed later that resignation would have
strengthened the forces that were, according to her thinking,
threatening democracy.
As Joe Elder, a British sociologist pointed out, “JP erred

672  
in launching a mass movement without a cadre of disciplined, nonviolent volunteers… his movement’s credibility was weakened by
the presence within it of extremists of the Left and Right. On
the other hand, the Prime Minister clearly over-reacted in imposing
the Emergency.”
P.N. Dhar said: “When the fateful moment arrived, JP did
not let the law take its own course. Whether it was his mistrust
of Indira Gandhi’s motives, or his own lack of faith in the democratic
method, or his ambition to go down in history as a political messiah
of the Indian people is beside the point. Similarly, Indira Gandhi
showed more faith in the repression of political opponents and
dissidents in her party than in her own ability to engage them
constructively or fight them politically. Whether she opted for the
Emergency to save herself from loss of power or as shock
treatment to bring the country back to sanity is also beside the
point. The fact remains that both JP and Indira Gandhi, between
whom the politics of India was then polarized, failed democracy
and betrayed their lack of faith in the rule of law.”

since I began to introduce certain progressive measures of
benefit for the common man and woman in India.” Those were
Indira Gandhi’s words to the nation in her broadcast over All
India Radio.
President’s rule was soon imposed on Gujarat and
Tamil Nadu, the two states where parties other than the
Congress ruled; the entire country thus came under direct
central rule or were under Congress governments. Emergency
powers were used to replace with compliant men those
Congress chief ministers who were strong and could offer
opposition to Indira Gandhi. All pending legislative assembly
elections were indefinitely postponed.
Most opposition leaders – Jayaprakash Narayan, Atal
Behari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh,
Asoka Mehta – and some Congress dissidents such as
Chandra Shekhar, as also many journalists (Ajit Bhattacharjea
and Kuldip Nayar to name two), trade union leaders, student
leaders and academicians were arrested under the Maintenance
of Internal Security Act (MISA). Several organisations of
extreme ideologies – the Anand Marg, the RSS, the Jamaati-Islami, the CPI(ML) – were banned.
As a result of the Emergency, the fundamental rights



 673

were suspended and civil liberties were curtailed with the
amendments to MISA and the Defence of India Act in July
1975. Parliament was practically ineffective as there was no
effective opposition to debate issues. Several decrees, laws
and even constitutional amendments were passed to reduce
the power of the judiciary and to declare that Parliament’s
right to amend the Constitution was unlimited. In this context,
the 42nd Amendment is memorable.
Censorship was imposed on the press and some
newspapers used to come out with blank spaces on the
editorial pages to signify that their views had been blacked
out for being critical of the situation. The Indian Express
and The Statesman will be remembered for trying their best
to put across criticism of the Emergency and the government.
The Emergency will be remembered for the ruthlessness
of the State: people were detained without charges, the law
enforcement authorities abused and even tortured those
arrested, and so-called programmes for development were
thrust on an unprepared people. The rise of Indira Gandhi’s
younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, to wield a power he did not hold
officially seemed ominous. He spearheaded the programmes
of destruction of crowded housing settlements and forced
sterilisation for controlling the population, causing misery
to thousands of people. He was, in the opinion of many,
instrumental in helping to set up what was in effect a police
state.
Support for the Emergency The imposition of
Emergency was not condemned outright by everyone. In fact,
considering that such a mass movement had been curbed and
JP arrested, no spontaneous demonstration took place. The
JP movement clearly did not have the support of people
across the socio-economic spectrum.
The middle classes on the whole initially welcomed the
Emergency: they were tired of the protest atmosphere and
were all in favour of some discipline and the control on
prices, for instance. Law and order certainly improved as did
administration, and there was a sense of calm that was
welcome. MISA was used to arrest smugglers, hoarders and
those indulging in black market. The suppression of strikes
also met with general approval.

674  

The announcement of the Twenty Point Programme
enthused the poorer and rural sections of population as well.
The economy improved initially, though it was mainly
because of the good monsoons. And, on the whole, people
believed that the Emergency was a temporary step to bring
the country back on the path of progress.
Even if the Congress party president Dev Kant Baruah’s
sycophantic praise of Indira Gandhi in 1976 that “India is
Indira, and Indira is India” was not shared by all, many eminent
personalities supported her step, at least initially.
The Communist Party of India was all in support of
the Emergency “to thwart right reactionary forces that is
using all the rights and liberties of parliamentary democracy
set up in order to destroy the freedom of the country”. The
party regretted its position later. The Communist Party
(Marxist), though, opposed it, and some of its members were
jailed.
Acharya Vinobha Bhave appreciated that it was time for
discipline to be imposed. Mother Teresa too supported Indira
Gandhi’s step for bringing calm and peace in the country.
Eminent journalist Khushwant Singh, surprisingly,
supported the Emergency in the beginning as he believed that
the JP movement would have led to anarchy in the country.
Later on, he was to change his view of the Emergency,
especially in light of the atrocities that were perpetrated.
Growth of Popular Discontent By mid-1976, the
popular mood had changed: there was discontent everywhere
as the economic improvement could not be sustained, the
criminals were back at their work, and the welfare programmes
failed to move at a fast enough pace to please the poor. Also,
it was the same corrupt and callous bureaucracy and
sycophantic and exploitative politicians who were handling
these programmes and the impact was therefore poor. The
strict and rigid discipline imposed did not meet with the
approval of government officials and teachers who also
resented being compelled to fulfil targets of getting people
sterilised. The police and bureaucracy had too much power
which they abused. Above all, the atmosphere of fear and
insecurity that had been created made people angry and
resentful, but these feelings had no vent as protest was



 675

forbidden even as there was no alternate way for getting
grievances against corrupt and abusive officials redressed.
Sanjay Gandhi’s rise to power without responsibility
created great unease and anger, not only among intellectuals
who feared the erosion of democratic values, but more so
among the common people who had to bear the brunt of the
demolition and sterilisation drives. Surprisingly, the points
he put forward were not in themselves bad, for he advocated
abolition of dowry, planting of trees and beautification of
cities, encouraging literacy, and limiting family size. But the
ruthless and insensitive way in which these ideas were
implemented caused great misery and shocked people. Abuse
of authority, apparently under the direction of Sanjay Gandhi,
was rampant. With no effective press to report with at least
some accuracy on the situation and with people disbelieving
the official publicity news, rumours of atrocities and violent
protest put down forcefully spread and were believed.
The scale of the Emergency atrocities were more in
the northern parts of the country than in the southern parts.
This was to be reflected in the election results of 1977.
In retrospect, the Emergency was one of the darkest
periods of post-independent history of India; the two-yearlong period was also perhaps a very significant episode in
the political evolution of the Indian National Congress.
A lasting effect of the Emergency was to be felt in
the way the Congress party worked since then. At the 1976
AICC session in Guwahati, the stage was set for sycophancy
as an important political need. In fact, sycophancy was
institutionalised and prepared the way for dynastic politics.
The Guwahati session marked the debut of Sanjay Gandhi in
politics, and the Youth Congress cemented the rise to power
by considering Sanjay to be the heir to the throne, so to say.
On Sanjay’s death, Rajiv Gandhi was to step into the space
created, even if reluctantly.
Elections of 1977
The Emergency was extended twice, and then most
unexpectedly Indira Gandhi called for elections. It is possible
that with just sycophants reporting to her about the situation
and the absence of a free press to give a correct picture,

676  
View

“. . . democracy not only throws up the mediocre
person but gives strength to the most vocal howsoever
they may lack knowledge and understanding.”
—Indira Gandhi
she thought people would endorse the policies brought in
under the Emergency rule and thus give them a popular
legitimacy. It has also been put forward by some that her
inherent democratic instincts were against continuing with
the draconian emergency rule. Yet others observe that when
she got an idea of the excesses being perpetrated she wanted
to get out of a situation that was getting out of her control.
The announcement of the elections came in January
1977. Political prisoners were released and press censorship
lifted, even as political parties were allowed to campaign
freely.
Opposition Gets Together In the elections, the
Congress of Indira Gandhi was opposed by an alliance of
opposition parties. The Jan Sangh, Congress (O), Bharatiya
Lok Dal led by Charan Singh, and the Socialist Party got
together to form the Janata Party. In February, Jagjivan Ram,
Nandini Satpathy and Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna left the
Congress of Indira Gandhi to form their own party, Congress
for Democracy (CFD). The CFD, Akali Dal, DMK and the
CPM allied with the Janata Party to fight the elections in
opposition to the Congress and its allies, the CPI and
AIADMK. After the elections, the CFD merged with the
Janata party.
A Historic Election The Janata alliance made the
excesses of the Emergency and the issue of civil liberties
the major planks of its election campaign. The people voted
in March 1977; the elections seemed to be practically a
referendum on the Emergency. The Janata alliance got a huge
mandate with 330 out of the 542 seats in the Lok Sabha.
The Congress was trounced, especially in the north, and its
allies did not perform well either. Both Indira Gandhi and
Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats. Incidentally, the Congress did
well in the south where it got most of the 150 odd seats



 677

it won. (The election results reflected the fact that the south
escaped much of the Emergency excesses; furthermore, the
pro-poor programmes were better implemented there than in
the north.)
Before the elections, many political observers of India
had despaired that democracy had no place in a country in
which a majority of the populace was illiterate and presumably
unaware of democratic values. They predicted that with the
Emergency, India would cease to be a democracy in the true
sense. But the elections proved that the Indian people were
astute and used their political power to good effect. The poor
too understood the value of civil rights. The elections which
brought a non-Congress government at the Centre for the first
time since independence showed that democracy was well
imbedded in the country.
The Emergency came to an end on Mach 21, 1977.

Developments in the Political System

The elections over time showed how the voters had changed.
The 1967 and the 1971 showed a marked increase in electoral
malpractices with booth capturing and rigging becoming
rampant. The Election Commission observed that casteism
that was becoming prominent, especially in Bihar, “vitiates
in no mean degree the political atmosphere”. This feature
has become practically entrenched in the country’s voting
behaviour.
Changes in the Congress
The 1971 elections – the fifth general elections since India
became independent – came earlier than the due date, thus
dissociating the national elections from the elections for the
state assemblies (the two had so far taken place
simultaneously). After the triumph in these elections, the
Congress led by Indira Gandhi dropped the (R) and adopted
the (I) to become Congress (I) and soon after dropped the
(I) as well: the margin of victory for her faction seemed to
confirm that it was the ‘real’ Congress. From now on, the
inner party democracy within the Congress was to get more
and more eroded.
A lasting effect of the Emergency was to be felt in
the way the Congress party worked since then. At the 1976

678  

AICC session in Guwahati, the stage was set for sycophancy
as an important political need. In fact, sycophancy was
institutionalised and prepared the way for dynastic politics.
The Guwahati session marked the debut of Sanjay Gandhi in
politics, and the Youth Congress reinforced the rise to power
by considering Sanjay to be the heir to the throne, so to say.
On Sanjay’s death, Rajiv Gandhi was to step into the space
created, even if reluctantly.
Growth of Regional Interests
Regional interests grew and took hold in many parts of the
country. At the level of the states, after the 1967 elections
the Congress had lost out in many; governments formed by
the Samyuktha Vidhayak Dal (SVD)—composed of the Jana
Sangh, socialists, the Swatantra Party, and defectors from the
Congress—came and went in the northern states. The rise
of the SVD is considered as the manifestation of the growing
political consciousness of the lower castes who had benefited
from the land reforms but had not got the political clout.
Most of these castes belonged to the intermediary position
below the brahmins and above the lowest, and formed the
dominant group in their respective areas. Incidentally the
politics increasingly became affected by the politics of
defection.
In southern India, especially in the Madras State (later
Tamil Nadu), a North-South divide was perceived: it was felt
that the North was trying to dominate and exploit the South.
Brahminism was, in fact, seen as a manifestation of this
exploitation as it was seen to have come from the North.
Language became a prominent bone of contention. The South,
especially Madras, viewed the possible imposition of Hindi
as official language with resentment. While the knowledge
of English was more or less evenly spread over the regions
of the country, imposition of Hindi would be very much to
the advantage of the people in the Hindi belt in the fields
of education and employment.
The three language formula calling for learning Hindi,
English and the regional language – each one with a different
script – was unsatisfactory as Tamilians would still have to
become proficient in all three while their ‘northern’



 679

counterpart would have no extra difficulty with their mother
tongue. Kerala, Mysore State (later Krnataka) and Andhra
adopted the three language formula. The southern demand that
northern states also include a southern language in a threelanguage policy for themselves was generally ignored. The
northern states either refused to adopt a three-language
formula, or if it was adopted, there was an option for taking
Sanskrit instead of the southern language, so the formula
itself had no meaning. It was in this background that the
Dravida parties gained prominence.
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), formed of the
middle castes of the region and firmly anti-brahmin in its
outlook, gained power in Madras; it came to power in the
state in the 1967 elections with a huge majority and formed
the first non-Congress government there under C.N. Annadurai.
Since then, the state has in most elections brought to power
either the DMK or the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (AIADMK), the group that separated from the
DMK under M.G. Ramachandran.
In Kerala, the Congress failed; CPI and the CPM came
together to form the government with E.M.S. Namboodiripad
once again becoming the chief minister.
In West Bengal after the 1969 election, the Congress
lost power, and a coalition government was formed by the
CPM and the Bangla Congress. Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla
Congress was the chief minister and Jyoti Basu of the CPM,
the home minister. There was trouble in the alliance and the
state government also had problems with the Centre. There
was also the conflict with the Naxalites, chiefly the Communist
Party Marxists-Leninists, in short, the CP(ML) formed in
1969 and led by Charu Mazumdar, consisting of those rebels
who left the CPM saying it had betrayed the ‘revolution’. It
was in the Naxalbari area that bordered Nepal and Pakistan
(at the time East Pakistan) that the rural poor had been
mobilised around 1967 by Kanu Sanyal of the CPM to
demonstrate against landlords who had evicted tenants. The
protests soon turned violent leading to the beheading of some
landlords. From the name of the place, the term ‘Naxalites’
grew to represent those who would resort to violence against
the State to protect the interests of the oppressed. Now the

680  

CP(ML) also attacked rival communists as agents of the
government and the police in urban areas; the police took
repressive action. They looked to China and Maoism for
inspiration. In the end they were successfully suppressed by
the government, though they continued to influence certain
areas of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, there was a fresh agitation demanding
the creation of Telengana with Hyderabad as its capital. The
Naxalites also established themselves in the rural areas here.
In Maharashtra, a new party Shiv Sena was founded in
1966 by Balasaheb Thackeray (more popularly called Bal
Thackeray), a cartoonist, in Mumbai. This party was vociferous
in its demand of ‘Bombay for Maharashtrians’, and targeted
the south Indians residing there, who, according to it, were
taking away jobs from the natives. There were even attacks
on the homes of south Indians and commercial establishments
run by south Indians. The Maharashtra for Maharashtrians
approach seemed to find favour with many of the inhabitants
and the Shiv Sena came second to the Congress in the
municipal elections of Bombay.
The calls for greater autonomy were reflected in the
border areas as well. Kashmir had gone through an election
in 1967, which was, to all purposes unfair, with Congress
candidates being elected without opposition as other
candidates’ nomination papers were rejected. Sheikh Abdullah,
under house arrest for some time, was released. His attitude
to the position of Kashmir vis-à-vis India remained ambivalent,
but according to some reports he was more ready than before
with the idea of Kashmir’s accession to India. After the IndoPakistani war of 1971, the new order in South Asia seemed
to indicate that India’s control over Kashmir was quite firm.
Sheikh Abdullah was in a mood for a more conciliatory
approach to the Centre, and Indira Gandhi was ready to open
a dialogue with him. He agreed not to raise the issue of selfdetermination for Kashmir but to limit his demand to just
greater autonomy within the Indian Union. He became the
Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and the leader of the
National Conference. There was relative peace and, in 1975,
Indira Gandhi declared the state of Jammu and Kashmir to
be a constituent of India.



 681

In 1966, Indira Gandhi accepted the Akalis’ demand that
Punjab be reorganised on linguistic lines. In consequence,
the southern part of Punjab which was predominantly Hindispeaking became a separate state, Haryana. At the same time,
the hilly areas in north-eastern Punjab were merged with
Himachal Pradesh. However, the contentious issue on the
status of Chandigarh, which the Akalis wanted to be the
capital of Punjab alone, was declared a union territory to be
shared by both the states as a capital. Though demonstrations
over the status of Chandigarh went on in 1968 and 1969,
and a veteran freedom fighter, Darshan Singh Pherumal,
fasted unto death, the initially temporary arrangement
continued indefinitely.
The north-eastern region of India has a strategic
importance. The Mizos rose up against the Government of
India in 1966, with the Mizo National Front (MNF) under
the leadership of Laldenga demanding sovereign independence
of Greater Mizoram. Indira Gandhi had to use the army to
quell the rebellion; the air force carried out strikes in Aizawl,
the only time the IAF was used in this way in civilian Indian
territory. With the 1971 war victory, the Mizo separatist
movement slowed down. Negotiating with the Mizo leaders,
the union government offered to turn Mizo Hills into a union
territory in July 1971. The Mizo leaders accepted the offer
on condition that the status of union territory would soon
be upgraded to statehood. In January 1972, the Union
Territory of Mizoram came into being. (Later, under Rajiv
Gandhi as prime minister, Mizoram was to become a fullfledged state in 1987.)
There was insurgency in Nagaland too. Nagaland had
been a part of Assam at the time of India’s independence,
but in 1963 it had become a separate state of India. But there
were extremists in the state who demanded a separate identity
outside the State of India. The radicals in charge of the
movement were ready to get help and training from China.
Violent clashes took place between the Naga rebels and the
Indian army. Indira Gandhi handled the situation with firmness,
especially during the Emergency. In March 1975, president’s
rule was imposed on the state. The leaders of largest rebel
groups agreed under the Shillong Accord in November 1975

682  

to lay down arms and accept the Indian Constitution. However,
a small group did not agree and spurts of violence and
conflict continued.
Statehood had also, in the meanwhile, been granted to
Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura in 1972, while the NorthEast Frontier Agency was made into a union territory and
renamed Arunachal Pradesh.
Annexation of Sikkim
Sikkim had become a protectorate of India in 1950. By 1974,
several elections had been held in Sikkim; in the last
elections, two rival parties merged to form the Sikkim
Congress and won a massive victory in the polls. This party
campaigned for greater political rights. The chogyal, the ruler
of Sikkim, tried to suppress the movement but was not
successful. He turned to India, and India prepared a constitution
for Sikkim. The constitution was approved by the national
assembly of Sikkim in 1974. In 1975, a special referendum
was held in which an overwhelming majority of the electorate
voted in favour of Sikkim’s merger with India. As a
consequence, Sikkim was incorporated into the Indian Union
as its 22nd state in May 1975 after the Thirty-sixth
Amendment of the Indian Constitution. Sikkim is of great
strategic importance for India because of its location bordering
on China.
Language Policy to Curb the Anti-Hindi
Disturbances
Indira Gandhi assuaged the sentiments of the non-Hindi
speaking states by getting the Official Languages Act amended
in 1967 to provide that the use of English could continue
until a resolution to end the use of the language was passed
by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi
as its official language, and by each house of the Indian
Parliament. This was a guarantee of de facto use of both Hindi
and English as official languages, thus establishing the
official government policy of bilingualism in India. The step
led to the end of the anti-Hindi protests and riots in some
states.
Centralisation of Power and the Socialistic Path
After she came back to power in 1967, Indira Gandhi
improved upon what Lal Bahadur Shastri had begun – having



 683

a number of advisers to the prime minister in the prime
minister’s secretariat (which came to be known as the prime
minister’s office when Morarji Desai became prime minister
in 1977). The real expansion of the prime minister’s secretariat
and its emergence as a power centre in its own right occurred
under Indira Gandhi with P.N. Haksar becoming the first
principal secretary to a prime minister. There was an increase
in the number of joint secretaries in the secretariat as well.
Indira Gandhi needed to show her independence of the
Syndicate within her party; she did not trust the politicians
and was not sure when they may conspire to get her removed.
She chose to depend on the advice of a team of advisers:
besides Haksar, there were T.N. Kaul, a career diplomat, D.P.
Dhar, politician turned diplomat, P.N. Dhar, economist turned
into bureaucrat, and R.N. Kao, security analyst. Incidentally,
the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was established in
1968 on the CIA model with Kao as its head.
Haksar, with a firm orientation towards the Left, was
the principal influence in the socialist path taken by Indira
Gandhi. Her other advisers were also enthusiastic about this
as they believed in socialistic ideals. They felt that the State
needed to have a greater role in the economy for social equity
to be ensured and national integration to be nurtured and
advanced. They were in favour of the public sector too for
promoting social integration. It is not certain that Indira
Gandhi held these ideals but she was pragmatic in her
awareness that it was what she needed to follow. Her advisers
helped develop her image as a socialist in economics, a
secularist in religious matters and as one who was pro-poor
and wanted development for all, says Ramachandra Guha.
Clipping the Wings of the Judiciary
The judiciary came in the way of implementing many of the
steps to facilitate quick social reforms. The contention over
property as a fundamental right was severe. The court had
obstructed the implementation of the abolition of privy
purses as well as the nationalisation of banks (which was
almost immediately implemented through a presidential
ordinance).
In 1971, the Twenty-fourth Constitutional Amendment

684  

Act was put in place that authorised Parliament to amend any
provision of the Constitution; this was to overcome the
restrictions placed by the Supreme Court on Parliament
regarding amendment of fundamental rights (Golaknath case).
In 1972 came the Twenty-fifth Constitutional Amendment
Act providing that giving effect to certain directive principles
could not be challenged in court on the grounds of their being
inconsistent with certain fundamental rights.
In 1973, the practice of appointing the senior most
Supreme Court judge as the Chief Justice of India was set
side, and Justice A.N. Ray was made Chief Justice of India
though there were three other judges senior to him. The
appointment was politically motivated as A.N. Ray was seen
to be on the government’s side. When the law passed by
Parliament giving it greater powers to amend the Constitution
had been challenged in the apex court, Justice Ray had voted
in favour of the government’s view: this was seen as having
influenced his promotion.
Then in 1975 came the Thirty-eighth Amendment Act
specifying that the satisfaction of the president or the
governor to declare emergency or issue ordinances could not
be challenged in court.
The Thirty-ninth Amendment Act of 1975 provided that
disputes regarding the election of the president, vice-president,
speaker and prime minister could not be heard by the high
courts or Supreme Court, but only by a special court to be
set up by Parliament.
The Forty-second Amendment was to further curtail the
power of the judiciary.
The Forty-Second Amendment Act: A Mini
Constitution of Sorts
In 1976 came the Forty-second Constitutional Amendment
Act that was the longest one till then and brought about
sweeping changes in the constitution, so much so that it came
to be called a mini constitution in itself. It added some 40
articles and a new chapter to the Constitution, besides adding
new words to the Preamble. The main ideas were to exclude
the courts entirely from election disputes; to concentrate
power in the central government as against the states so that



 685

the country could be ruled as a unitary and not a federal
polity; to protect revolutionary social legislation from judicial
scrutiny; and to further curb the power of the judiciary so
that it would be difficult for the court to upset parliament’s
policy regarding certain matters.
Some of the huge changes the amendment brought
about that affected the democratic system are given below.
Some of these steps would be repealed by the Janata
government that came in 1977.
The 42nd Amendment placed amendments outside the
purview of courts, further declaring that there was to be no
limitation on the power of Parliament to amend the
Constitution. It curtailed the powers of the high courts and
the Supreme Court in matters of judicial review and writ
jurisdiction.
In the Preamble India was now characterised as
‘sovereign, socialist secular democratic republic’ instead of
the original ‘sovereign democratic republic’. Besides, the
words ‘unity of the nation’ was changed to ‘unity and integrity
of the nation’.
New directive principles were added to the Constitution,
and the directive principles were, on the whole, accorded
primacy over the fundamental rights.
A new chapter on fundamental duties was added to the
Constitution.
The term of the Lok Sabha was extended from five
years to six years. It further froze the number of seats in
constituencies for election to Lok Sabha, and state legislative
assemblies at the 1971 census level till the first census after
2000; there was to be no readjustment every ten years after
every census as was the practice till then.
The laws made by Parliament to deal with anti-national
activities were declared to take precedence over fundamental
rights. The necessity of quorum in Parliament as well as in
state legislatures was discarded.
As per its provisions, the proclamation of national
emergency could be made for a part of territory of India.
The duration of president’s rule without Parliament’s approval
was extended from six months to one year. The Centre was
given the power to deploy armed forces in a state if a serious
situation of law and order arose.

686  

Socio-Economic Policies

It was P.N. Haksar who apparently advised Indira Gandhi that
if she wanted to get control of her party she must oppose
the Syndicate on ideological lines. So she presented the
socialistic path to be adopted for the good of the country.
Several steps were taken in keeping with this socialistic
ideology.
Nationalisation of Banks and Other Sectors of
Economy
Bank nationalisation was a step on this path, as Indira Gandhi
sided with the Young Turks (one of whose leaders was
Chandra Shekhar). She relieved Morarji Desai of his finance
portfolio as he opposed the idea, pointing out that the step
would cause a strain on the government administration and
lead to lower resources for economic development even as
it increased bureaucratic control. Indira Gandhi then adopted
the ordinance way to nationalise fourteen major private banks
in July 1969. The ordinance was later passed by Parliament
to become the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer
of Undertakings) Act. (In 1980, when Indira Gandhi came
back to power, another six banks were nationalised.)
The prime minister explained over the radio that India
might be an ancient country but was a young democracy and,
as such, should remain vigilant against the “domination of
the few over the social, economic or political systems”.
Banks, she said, should be publicly owned so that they catered
to not just large industries and big business but also to
agriculturists, small industries and entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
the private banks had been functioning erratically with
hundreds of them failing and causing loss to the depositors
who were given no guarantee against such loss.
The nationalisation did result in a huge expansion of
the banking sector with branches not only increasing in
numbers but also coming up in remote and rural areas where
the formal credit system was hitherto unknown. Household
savings increased with deposits increasing. Investments rose
in the informal sector. The nationalisation of banks led to
credit being provided to agriculture and small and medium
industries. It was stipulated that banks had to reserve a certain



 687

percentage of credit to the priority sectors (agriculture and
small and medium industries). Differential interest rates
scheme introduced in 1972 required the public sector banks
to provide at lower than normal rates of interest to the weaker
sections of the society.
After being re-elected in 1971 on a campaign that
endorsed nationalisation, Indira Gandhi went on to nationalise
the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance
industries. The main reasons were to protect employment and
the interests of the organised labour. Whatever industries
remained in private hands were strictly regulated. The foreignowned private oil companies in the India created obstructions
for India by refusing to supply fuel to the Indian forces during
the war of 1971. In consequence, Indira Gandhi nationalised
the oil companies in 1973; since then, the major oil
companies have to maintain a minimum stock of oil for
military use when needed.
Abolition of Princely Privileges
After India got independence, the rulers of the princely states,
on merging with the State of India (thus losing the right to
rule), were granted a ‘privy purse’ by the Government of
India. This ‘purse’ was a certain amount of money, payable
annually to the rulers (and their successors) of such states
in proportion to their revenue, ranking as a salute state under
the British Raj, the antiquity of the dynasty, etc. Article 291
of the Constitution of India, the privy purse would be a fixed,
tax-free amount guaranteed to the former princely rulers and
their successors. The quantum of these ‘purses’ ranged from
Rs 5,000 per annum to Rs 26 lakh per annum.
The privileges enjoyed by erstwhile rulers were often
questioned and considered by many to be a relic of the past.
The 1969 attempt by the Indira Gandhi government to abolish
the ‘privy purse’ system and the official recognition of the
titles did not meet with success: the Constitutional Amendment
Bill to this effect was passed in the Lok Sabha, but it failed
to get the required two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha.
It was only in 1971 that with the passage of the Twenty-sixth
Amendment to the Constitution of India that the privy purses
were abolished.

688  

As per the objectives and reason stated in the amendment
bill, “The concept of rulership, with privy purses and special
privileges unrelated to any current functions and social
purposes was incompatible with an egalitarian social order.
The Government, therefore, decided to terminate the privy
purses and privileges of the rulers of former Indian States.
It was necessary for this purpose, apart from amending the
relevant provisions of the Constitution, to insert a new article
therein so as to terminate expressly the recognition already
granted to such rulers and to abolish privy purses and
extinguish all rights, liabilities and obligations in respect of
privy purses.” Thus Article 363-A was inserted in the
Constitution. Besides, the abolition of the privy purses would
reduce the government’s revenue deficit.
MRTP Act
In 1969 the Indira Gandhi government was able to get the
Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act
passed after abolishing the managing agency system; the
latter, it was thought, enabled a small number of capitalists
to control a large number of industrial enterprises even
though they had little or no financial stake in them. The
MRTP Commissioner was to check the concentration of
economic power wielded by a few leading business families.
Steps for Equity and Poverty Reduction
It was under Indira Gandhi’s administration that a clause
calling for equal pay for equal work for both men and women
was enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
It was also in the cause of social equity that the princely
privileges were withdrawn.
Her programme for poverty reduction and redistribution
of wealth included rapid enforcement of land ceilings –
agricultural as well as urban land ownership; legislation for
redistribution of land to the marginal farmers was also passed
in many states.
A programme was initiated for distribution of food
grains at low cost to the economically vulnerable sections
of population. A crash programme for creation of employment
in rural areas was also devised.
Programmes for building houses for landless labourers

“. . . even the late prime minister’s critics would concede

was brought about during her tenure.”

“I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have to
understand what we mean by that term...we used the word
[socialism] because it came closest to what we wanted to
do here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it
socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy,
I don’t see why we should use it. I don’t believe in words
at all.”
Indira Gandhi

were designed. At least on paper, bonded labour was
abolished and there was a moratorium on the debts of the
poor.
As already mentioned, the nationalised banks had to
keep in mind priority sector lending.
The nature of the reforms has been criticised, but it
cannot be denied that the social changes had the long-term
effect of bringing to prominence middle-ranking farmers
from the lower castes. And these classes were to pose a
challenge in the political system in the North.

Tackling Economic Problems

In the mid-sixties, Indian economy was going through a crisis.
There were shortage of food grains, a huge fiscal deficit, and
a deterioration in the balance of payments situation. This led
to a greater dependence on foreign aid. The war with Pakistan
in 1965 resulted in the suspension of food aid from the US
which refused to renew the PL-480 agreement. In the
circumstances, five-year planning was suspended in favour of
annual plans (between 1966 and 1969).
Inflation remained high except during the Emergency.
Unemployment too was a grave problem.
Devaluation of the Rupee
There was pressure from the US, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund on India to reduce its controls
over trade and industry and to devalue the rupee. Indira Gandhi

690  

did devalue the rupee in June 1966 by 36.5 per cent,
increasing the dollar’s value against it by 57.4 per cent.
(According to B.K. Nehru’s account in Nice Guys Finish
Second, Lal Bahadur Shastri had decided upon devaluation
as early as January 1966 before he went to Tashkent.) The
idea behind the step was that devaluation would help India
sell more abroad and get the dollars to pay for its imports
of food, oil and capital goods.
The step was severely criticised. The critics seemed
to be vindicated when the World Bank fell short on its
commitment to quickly organise more aid. Foreign capital
did not come as expected. Indira Gandhi felt betrayed and
lost faith in promises made by the West – this could have
been a factor in her subsequent shift leftward. Furthermore,
another drought added to macroeconomic difficulties, and the
effect of devaluation was ineffective due to contradictory
export-import policies. Devaluation thus came to be seen as
a failure. The medium-term effect of devaluation was, in fact,
beneficial: India managed to avert famine as well as bankruptcy,
and the trade deficit reduced drastically by 1970-71. In the
short term, however, it led to inflation and failed to the extent
that it was not accompanied by other reforms.
In the circumstances, the idea of liberalising the
economy became politically unacceptable and was abandoned.
Indira Gandhi chose to control the deficit through drastically
cutting down government expenditure. This led to an industrial
slowdown. Indira Gandhi had by now turned leftwards and
launched some radical policies – nationalising banks and
insurance, enacting the MRTP Act, enacting the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) which placed restrictions
on foreign investment and foreign companies functioning in
India, taking over ‘sick’ companies (especially in the textiles
sector) rather than letting them close down. In the long term,
some of these steps weakened the Indian economy, causing
stagnation and slow growth, but in the short term, they led
to an improvement in the economic situation, so much so
that India was able to stay clear of a debt crisis. Foreign
exchange was painstakingly built up. The resolve was to avoid
food aid; it seemed sensible to use the foreign exchange to
buy food grains commercially – as was done after the poor



 691

harvests in 1972. Of course, the success of the Green
Revolution helped to restore the food economy.
Fourth Five-Year Plan
The much postponed Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-1974) was
at last launched. Its investment outlay was almost double that
of the Third Plan. The goal was stated to be “growth with
stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance”.
The plan was dovetailed to the socialist principles
adopted by Indira Gandhi by then. The rationale was the Ten
Point Programme put forward by Indira Gandhi in 1967, her
first economic policy formulation soon after taking office
of prime minister. The programme placed an emphasis on
greater state control of the economy as it was believed that
government control ensured greater welfare than leaving the
economy to the private sector. So the private sector needed
to be regulated. By the end of the 1960s, the liberalisation
process had been reversed, and India’s policies could be
called as ‘protectionist’.
The government intended that India should be free of
dependence on foreign aid and emphasise on increasing
agricultural and industrial production.
The objectives of the Fourth Plan included: increasing
the income of the rural population and augmenting the supply
of food; making efforts towards maximising production;
attaining stability of prices; making policies to encourage
mixed economy; bringing about human resource development,
especially in rural areas. It was intended to provide for the
minimum needs of the community through a rural works
programme.
The performance of the plan was not as good as
expected, though many of the social goals were realised. The
shortfall in targets was mainly because the war with Pakistan
and dealing with the refugees from East Pakistan took their
toll, and because of the 1973 oil crisis.
Green Revolution Success
The bright spot on the economic scene was the success of
the new agricultural strategy. The Green Revolution, the
seeds of which had been sown in Lal Bahadur Shastri’s tenure,
bore fruit and benefited the government of Indira Gandhi. The

692  

new dwarf varieties of wheat that the Punjab and Haryana
farmers adopted led to bumper harvests. The new varieties
of rice, groundnut and cotton too did well. Production of
wheat, especially, grew sensationally. There were shortcomings
in the strategy: huge regional variations, large areas unaffected
by the ‘revolution’ still depending on the erratic monsoons,
growth in the disparity of farmers’ income and what was to
be seen much later – the damage to the environment overuse
of chemical fertilisers and wastage of water. But at the time,
the feeling was that endemic food shortage had ended.
Fifth Five-Year Plan
The Fifth Five-year Plan (1974-1979) did not last its full
term, but its programmes mostly coincided with the Emergency
period. The plan was targeted at reducing poverty through
addressing the consumption needs of the poor and by enacting
a range of socio-economic reforms. This was more or less
an aspect of the Twenty Point Programme. With the
Emergency in place, the economic programmes could be
implemented forcefully. Indeed, with the economy growing
at the rate of 9 per cent in 1975–76 alone, the Fifth Plan
was the first plan during which the per capita income grew
by over 5 per cent. However, with the elections of 1977 and
the Janata government coming to power, the Fifth Plan period
was curtailed and it was ended in 1978.

The Indo-Pak War of 1971 and the Birth
of Bangladesh

The war between India and Pakistan in 1971 was a milestone
in that it saw the liberation of East Pakistan resulting in the
birth of a new nation, Bangladesh.
The 1970 Polls in Pakistan and Unrest in East
Pakistan
In 1970, General Yahya Khan, who had succeeded Ayub Khan
as president and chief martial law administrator in Pakistan,
promised to restore democracy in Pakistan and duly called
for general elections – the first ever election based on adult
franchise in that country. Also, the number of seats to the
National Assembly was to be in proportion to the population.
East Pakistan, the more populous of the two wings of



 693

Pakistan, was thus, naturally, allotted more seats than West
Pakistan.
In West Pakistan, the dominant party was the Pakistan
People’s Party (PPP) led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, while in
East Pakistan the Awami League led by Mujibur Rahman was
the dominant party. Mujibur Rahman spoke of the eastern
wing being repressed by the military rulers and treated as
a colony to cater to West Pakistan’s interests. The East
Pakistanis resented their language—Bengali—being side lined
and the low representation of their people in the higher
administrative sections of the country. Mujibur Rahman
demanded greater autonomy and a true federal constitution
with greater powers for the East wing. The poll was held in
December 1970 and the results showed where Pakistan was
heading. While the PPP won a majority of seats in West
Pakistan, the Awami League simply swept the elections in
East Pakistan and, in the process, got a majority over all.
Yahya Khan did not like the prospect of an assembly
led by an East Pakistani and dominated by East Pakistanis
with their demand for autonomy in framing a new democratic
constitution. There was also a fear among the West Pakistan
rulers that the Hindus in East Pakistan, many of whom were
well-educated professionals, might influence the writing of
the constitution. Yahya Khan with the endorsement of
Zulfiqar Bhutto postponed convening the National Assembly.
This angered the East Pakistanis, and the call for a general
strike by the Awami League met with a good response. In
March 1971, the Pakistani military regime took steps to
crush the protest and sent tanks and forces into East Pakistan.
Mujibur Rahman was arrested and moved to an unknown
destination. There seemed little chance for reconciliation
after the violent clashes and the brutal killing of civilians,
especially students, by the Pakistani army.
Refugee Influx in India and Indian Response
One consequence of the civil war in East Pakistan was the
exodus of refugees (mostly Hindus) from that country into
India, the numbers running into millions by August 1971.
India allowed these refugees in and set up camps for them
(in West Bengal, Tripura and Meghalaya, and even in Madhya

694  

Pradesh and Orissa) and fed them. It was the central
government that bore the cost of all this.
In the beginning, India mounted diplomatic efforts at
convincing the world powers of the desperate situation
building up. Indira Gandhi contacted the US on the matter.
Henry Kissinger, the national security adviser to the US
president at the time, brought a letter from the US president
asking India to send back the refugees under UN supervision.
Indira Gandhi pointed out that the American arms given to
Pakistan, which were once used against India in 1965, were
now being used by Pakistan against its own people. She also
asked if the refugees from Hitler’s Germany would have been
repatriated under the conditions that existed at the time. It
is now known that Kissinger and Nixon differed in their
opinions on the situation. Nixon favoured Pakistan, especially
as it had secretly helped Kissinger establish contact on behalf
of the US with China, and did not want to help India.
The USSR, as opposed to the US, agreed with India on
the situation on the subcontinent – that the two wings of
Pakistan had drifted too apart for a possible reconciliation.
The USSR offered military equipment to India. It also
proposed a friendship treaty with India, which would act as
a deterrent to Pakistan and China if they thought of getting
together and indulging in military adventurism. When India’s
foreign minister at the time, Swaran Singh, visited Moscow
in June 1971 and met his Soviet counterpart, Andrei Gromyko,
and the president, Alexei Kosygin, it was decided that such
a friendship treaty would be signed. In August 1971, the
foreign ministers of the two countries signed the Treaty of
Peace, Friendship and Cooperation. The most significant part
of the treaty spoke of the mutual consultations on suitable
measures to be taken in the face of any attack or threat of
an attack on either country so as to remove the threat and
ensure peace and security of their countries.
By the summer of 1971, India had decided to intervene
actively in the situation. Indian forces began to provide
instruction in the use of weapons to Bengali guerrillas in
training camps. The group of these fighters, comprising
regular soldiers of the erstwhile united Pakistan as well as
fresh volunteers, was known as the Mukti Bahini. These



 695

guerrillas were to sneak across the border into East Pakistan
to attack army camps and communication installations. The
Mukti Bahini was to play an important role in the liberation
of East Pakistan.
Indira Gandhi toured the world to acquaint the leaders
of the situation on the subcontinent. The country that could
have made a difference, namely the USA, remained
unimpressed. In November 1971, Richard Nixon and Indira
Gandhi met but did not agree on the situation; Nixon said
that the US would not agree to overthrow Yahya Khan and
warned India against taking military action.
In the meanwhile, the situation along the border between
India and East Pakistan had reached conflict stage with
shelling across the line taking place. It was an opportunity
for the members of the Mukti Bahini to use the exchange
of fire to cross the border to carry out their insurgent
activity.
War and Liberation of East Pakistan
Pakistan chose to attack India on the western border on
December 3, 1971. As their bombers targeted airfields along
the western borders, their artillery regiments attacked Kashmir.
India under the generalship of Sam Manekshaw took swift
action in Kashmir and Punjab on the ground and with massive
air strikes. The Indian navy got into action for the first time
and moved towards Karachi. The Western Naval Command
under Vice Admiral S.N. Kohli, successfully launched a
surprise attack on Karachi port under the codename Trident.
India now had every reason to push across into Eastern
Pakistan with its troops and tanks and to turn the secret
skirmishes into open confrontation.
It must be pointed out here that India had modernised
its armed forces, besides starting indigenous weapons
manufacture. The Pakistani military was no match for the
Indian forces. There was a further handicap that the Pakistanis
were working under – the low morale of its forces due to
the civil unrest and defection of Bengali personnel and the
stress of having to fight people of their own country. It has
been pointed out that Yahya Khan’s strategy was difficult to
understand. If Chinese help was anticipated, it did not come;

696  

perhaps the snow in the Himalayas in December did not allow
any Chinese action. The Indian forces, on the other hand, had
no problem with weather on the eastern front and furthermore
were helped by the locals and the Mukti Bahini. Moving
towards Dacca (now Dhaka) from four directions, the Indian
forces captured strategic installations. The Indian Eastern
Naval Command, under Vice Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan,
created a naval blockade in the Bay of Bengal and isolated
East Pakistan. From December 4 onwards, the aircraft carrier
INS Vikrant was deployed to carry out attacks on the major
ports of East Pakistan.
India’s intention for East Pakistan became clear on
December 6, 1971 when the Indian government formally
recognised the Provisional Government of the People’s
Republic of Bangladesh.
The US sent Task Force 74 led by the aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise i into the Bay of Bengal, but it was just a
show of power and an indication of the US stand. It did not
affect the course of what happened to East Pakistan. It was
now clear that Dacca was going to fall to the Indian forces,
and what is more, once the East Pakistan issue was settled,
India might turn its full attention to West Pakistan and also
cause its disintegration.
On December 13, the Yahya Khan sent a message to
Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niazi, the Commander of the
Pakistan Eastern Command, to give up arms. But it was
December 16, 1971 before the Instrument of Surrender of
Pakistan Eastern Command stationed in East Pakistan, was
signed between the Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora,
the GOC-in-C of Indian Eastern Command and LieutenantGeneral A.A.K. Niazi, the Commander of the Pakistan Eastern
Command, at the Ramna Race Course in Dacca.
East Pakistan had been liberated and a new independent
nation Bangladesh had come into being. Mujibur Rahman,
released from captivity, assumed the leadership of the new
nation.
On December 16, Indira Gandhi announced on radio a
unilateral ceasefire on the western front as well. The next
day, Pakistan too announced a ceasefire.



 697

Indira Gandhi’s image was greatly enhanced as an effect
of the victory. Many in India called her ‘Durga’. There was
a new confidence and a sense of power and achievement in
the Indians. The country seemed to have established a
dominant position in the subcontinent.
The Simla Agreement
In Pakistan, following the war, Yahya Khan resigned and
Zulfiqar Bhutto took over. Bhutto was reported to be in
favour of beginning a new relationship with India. India was
not against the idea. Bhutto was invited for a summit at Simla
in June 1972. At the meeting, the Indians expressed the need
for a comprehensive treaty settling all outstanding problems
including Kashmir. But the Pakistanis preferred a step by step
approach. In the end, whereas the Indian side wanted a ‘nowar pact’, it had to agree to a ‘renunciation of force’ by both
sides. The Kashmir issue was left hanging, and regarding the
Line of Control which India wanted to be respected by both
sides Pakistan added the caveat, ‘without prejudice to the
recognised position of either side’. Many of India’s demands
were watered down, and India apparently went with it because
it realised the precarious position held by Bhutto in Pakistan
and pushing too hard may have deposed him and made the
situation worse. The agreement (not treaty, as India wanted)
was signed on July 2.
The Simla Agreement was considered to be a
comprehensive blue print for good neighbourly relations
between India and Pakistan. Under the agreement both
countries undertook to abjure conflict and confrontation, and
to work towards the establishment of durable peace, friendship
and cooperation.
The two countries agreed to follow a set of guiding
principles in managing relations with each other: respect for
each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty; noninterference in each other’s internal affairs; respect for each
other’s unity, political independence; sovereign equality; and
abjuring hostile propaganda.
There was a mutual commitment to the peaceful
resolution of all issues through direct bilateral approaches,
and to build the foundations of a cooperative relationship with
special focus on people to people contacts.

698  

Text of the Simla Agreement
1.The Government of India and the Government of Pakistan
are resolved that the two countries put an end to the conflict and
confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations and work
for the promotion of a friendly and harmonious relationship and
the establishment of durable peace in the sub-continent, so that
both countries may henceforth devote their resources and energies
to the pressing talk of advancing the welfare of their peoples.
In order to achieve this objective, the Government of India
and the Government of Pakistan have agreed as follows:
● That the principles and purposes of the Charter of the
United Nations shall govern the relations between the two
countries;
● That the two countries are resolved to settle their differences
by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any
other peaceful means mutually agreed upon between them.
Pending the final settlement of any of the problems between
the two countries, neither side shall unilaterally alter the
situation and both shall prevent the organization, assistance
or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance
of peaceful and harmonious relations;
● That the pre-requisite for reconciliation, good neighbourliness
and durable peace between them is a commitment by both
the countries to peaceful co-existence, respect for each
other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty and non-interference
in each other’s internal affairs, on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit;
● That the basic issues and causes of conflict which have
bedevilled the relations between the two countries for the
last 25 years shall be resolved by peaceful means;
● That they shall always respect each other’s national unity,
territorial integrity, political independence and sovereign
equality;
● That in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations
they will refrain from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or political independence of each
other.
2. Both Governments will take all steps within their power
to prevent hostile propaganda directed against each other. Both
countries will encourage the dissemination of such information as
would promote the development of friendly relations between them.



 699

3. In order progressively to restore and normalize relations
between the two countries step by step, it was agreed that;
● Steps shall be taken to resume communications, postal,
telegraphic, sea, land including border posts, and air links
including overflights.
● Appropriate steps shall be taken to promote travel facilities
for the nationals of the other country.
● Trade and co-operation in economic and other agreed fields
will be resumed as far as possible.
● Exchange in the fields of science and culture will be
promoted.
In this connection delegations from the two countries will meet
from time to time to work out the necessary details.
4. In order to initiate the process of the establishment of
durable peace, both the Governments agree that:
● Indian and Pakistani forces shall be withdrawn to their side
of the international border.
● In Jammu and Kashmir, the line of control resulting from
the cease-fire of December 17, 1971 shall be respected
by both sides without prejudice to the recognized position
of either side. Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally,
irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations.
Both sides further undertake to refrain from the threat or
the use of force in violation of this Line.
● The withdrawals shall commence upon entry into force of
this Agreement and shall be completed within a period of
30 days thereof.
5. This Agreement will be subject to ratification by both
countries in accordance with their respective constitutional
procedures, and will come into force with effect from the date on
which the Instruments of Ratification are exchanged.
6. Both Governments agree that their respective Heads will
meet again at a mutually convenient time in the future and that,
in the meanwhile, the representatives of the two sides will meet
to discuss further the modalities and arrangements for the
establishment of durable peace and normalization of relations,
including the questions of repatriation of prisoners of war and
civilian internees, a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir and
the resumption of diplomatic relations.

However, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s speech in Pakistan’s
National Assembly soon after the agreement indicated that
the Kashmir issue was very much alive and that Pakistan was
ready to help the people of Kashmir if they started a freedom
movement.
In 1976, in spite of the Pokhran nuclear test by India
and the hostile reception to it in Pakistan, the two countries
agreed to reopen diplomatic establishments and normalise
relations.

Foreign Policy and Relations with other
Countries

Bangladesh India’s relations with Bangladesh were
specially cordial with Mujibur Rahman in power. However,
Mujibur Rahman’s policies that were pro-India did not meet
with approval of many in the political and military circles
of Bangladesh as they feared Bangladesh would become some
kind of satellite state to India. Mujibur Rahman was
assassinated in 1975, following which came Islamist and
military regimes. Indira Gandhi’s relations with these regimes
was uncomfortable. But on the whole the relations between
the two countries remained amicable.
Sri Lanka Indira Gandhi had cordial relations with her
Sri Lankan counterpart, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and was
initially accommodative about the ethnic problem involving
the Tamils in that island country.
In 1974, India ceded the tiny islet of Katchatheevu to
Sri Lanka in order to save Bandaranaike’s socialist government
from a political disaster. In 1974, India ceded the small islet
Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka through the Indo-Sri Lankan
Maritime Agreement that was intended to settle the maritime
boundary in the Palk Strait. Sirimavo’s popularity was rather
low at the time, and Indira Gandhi decided to cede the island
so as to improve the image of the Sri Lankan prime minister
and to help stabilise the Bandranaike regime in Sri Lanka.
The agreement, which did not specify fishing rights,
allowed Indian fishermen to fish around Katchatheevu and to
dry their nets on the island. However, in 1976, without
consulting the Tamil Nadu assembly or Parliament Indira
Gandhi’s government finalised another agreement to determine



 701

the boundary in the Gulf of Mannar and Bay of Bengal and
restricted both the countries’ fishermen from fishing in the
other’s waters: “The fishing vessels and fishermen of India
shall not engage in fishing in the historic waters, the
territorial sea and the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka,
nor shall the fishing vessels and fishermen of Sri Lanka
engage in fishing in the historic waters, the territorial sea
and the Exclusive Economic Zone of India, without the
express permission of Sri Lanka or India, as the case may
be,” said the agreement.
Soviet Union Under Indira Gandhi, India’s relations
with the Soviet Union deepened, especially in light of the
attitudes of the US and China regarding Pakistan. The Treaty
of Friendship with the USSR was a move to counter the
Chinese closeness with Pakistan. When the US introduced
a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan
after Pakistan began the attack on the western front, the
Soviet Union vetoed the resolution. Though the Soviet Union
was not happy with India’s nuclear test of 1974, it did not
support further action against India. Certainly, there was a
tilt towards the Soviet Union for pragmatic reasons during
the times of Indira Gandhi.
United States From the time Indira Gandhi came to
power, the relations with the US were strained. When Lyndon
Johnson was president and India was reliant on the US for
food aid, Indira Gandhi resented aid with strings attached –
that in return for food, India was expected to agree to the
policies of the US. She was also firm about not signing the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
After Nixon came to power in the US, relations deteriorated;
Nixon disliked Indira Gandhi as well as the Indians and had
a clear bias for Pakistan. Indira Gandhi expressed her
criticism of the Vietnam war as well.
West Asia Indira Gandhi fully supported the Palestinians’
cause and against Israel. The pro-Arab stand had mixed
results, especially after the war with Pakistan. While some
of the Arab governments remained neutral (Egypt, Algeria,
Syria, for instance), the conservative pro-American Arab
monarchies in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab

702  

Emirates supported Pakistan. Libya saw the Indian intervention
in East Pakistan as an attack on Islam.
Ties with Iran floundered for a while in the wake of
the Indo-Pak war, with Iran viewing India’s tilt towards
Moscow and the break-up of Pakistan as part of a larger
conspiracy against Iran involving India, Iraq, and the Soviet
Union. However, Iran had not agreed to activate the Baghdad
Pact and draw in the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO)
into the conflict at Pakistan’s instigation. By 1974, the
relations had recovered enough for Iran and India to come
to an agreement that led to Iran supplying a substantial amount
of crude to India.
Asia-Pacific In 1967, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) was formed. In India’s view ASEAN
was a pro-US organisation with links to the SEATO. The
ASEAN countries were not happy about India’s stance over
Vietnam and the close ties with Moscow. Nor did India’s
nuclear test meet with their approval; they saw it as contributing
to the tension in the region.
Africa India’s image as a vigorous opponent of
colonialism suffered in African eyes because of the cordial
relations India maintained with the Commonwealth of Nations.
Initially, India condemned the armed struggle in Kenya and
Algeria for independence. Under Indira Gandhi, relations
began to be repaired. Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Libya –
the countries that had supported India during the Sino-Indian
War in 1962 got special attention after she came to power.
Diplomatic and economic relations with these states were
expanded. Unlike her father, Indira Gandhi openly supported
the liberation struggles in Africa. India’s image too had
improved in the world with the nuclear test and the refusal
to be bullied by the US in the Indo-Pak war of 1971.
Furthermore, Indira Gandhi firmly connected the Indian antiimperialist interests in Africa and those of the Soviet Union.
The experience of Indians in Uganda, however, was depressing:
they suffered persecution in the Idi Amin regime and were
eventually expelled from that nation.

The Smiling Buddha

Though it could be seen as a part of the national security
policy, it was scientific endeavour that led to India’s successful



 703

detonation of a nuclear device. On May 18, 1974, India
conducted its first nuclear test in the Thar Desert of
Rajasthan, at the army base near the village of Pokhran.
Officially termed Pokhran I but code named ‘Smiling Buddha’,
the exercise was an underground detonation. It was formally
called a ‘peaceful nuclear explosion’. It was the first time
that a confirmed nuclear test was done by a nation that was
not one of the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council.
It is believed that Indira Gandhi authorised the
development of nuclear weapon system, presumably in light
of China slowly and steadily becoming a nuclear power. She
was guided by the belief that it was in the interests of the
stability and security of India if it was to develop independently
of the nuclear superpowers. The nuclear device, which was
of the implosion type and was said to resemble the American
nuclear bomb called ‘Fat Man’, was developed under the
guidance of Raja Ramanna who was then the Director of the
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). The project was
overseen by the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission,
Homi Sethna. Some of the other scientists of renown
involved in the projects were P.K. Iyengar, R. Chidambaram,
Basanti Nagchaudhuri and Waman Dattatreya Patwardhan.
Though there was euphoria in many sections of the
population, there was also a perception that the test was
authorised by Indira Gandhi to divert attention from the unrest
that was going on in the country.
International Reaction Though India called it a test
for ‘peaceful purposes’, the rest of the world was not too
happy about it. The Nuclear Suppliers Group was formed to
check nuclear proliferation.
As the plutonium used in the test came from the CIRUS
reactor supplied by Canada and the heavy water was supplied
by the US, the two countries were unhappy. Canada suspended
assistance for the two heavy water reactors then under
construction.
Pakistan was furious, and cancelled the talks that were
soon to take place for the normalisation of relations.
Pakistan’s prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto declared that
he would not be blackmailed by India and would not accept

704  

India’s domination in the subcontinent. The Indian test,
according to Pakistani opinion, pushed Pakistan into the
nuclear field.

The Janata Party Years
(March 1977 – January 1980)
The Janata Party contesting under the symbol of ‘chakrahaldhar’ and its allies won a massive majority in the 1977
elections.

Morarji Desai the First Non-Congress
Prime Minister

There were three contenders for the post of prime minister,
namely, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram. It was
left to Acharya Kripalani and Jayaprakash Narayan to decide
who would become prime minister. Their choice was Morarji
Desai who duly took the oath as prime minister on March
23, 1977. Charan Singh (minister of home, and later of
finance) and Jagjivan Ram (defence minister) were deputy
prime ministers.

Fresh State Assembly Elections

It was felt that the nation had expressed its dissatisfaction
with the Congress and hence the states under Congress rule
should also have fresh elections. These state assemblies were
dissolved and elections were held in June. As a result of the
elections, the Janata Party was able to form governments in
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. In Punjab, the Janata Party
and the Akali Dal formed a coalition government. In Tamil
Nadu, the AIADMK swept the elections and its leader, M.G.
Ramachandran formed the government. His government was
not interested in confrontational politics with the Centre; it
was also to be the pioneer in launching the midday meal
scheme to encourage children, specially girls, to attend
school. In West Bengal, a coalition of left parties won a good
majority with the CPM doing exceptionally well, and Jyoti
Basu became the chief minister. The left government was to
undertake agrarian reforms from which a large number of
poor peasants benefited.



 705

In Jammu and Kashmir, Sheikh Abdullah had led the
Congress government consequent to an accord with Indira
Gandhi before the Emergency. Now the Morarji Desai
government dissolved the assembly and initiated fresh polls
to install a mandated government in the state. Sheikh Abdullah
revived his party, the National Conference, and, in the first
truly fair and free polls in the state since independence, his
party won a comfortable majority. However, the divide
between the Muslim-dominated Valley and the Hindudominated Jammu became apparent with the National
Conference not doing so well in Jammu.

New President of India

With a hold on most states, the Janata Party was able to get
its candidate, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, elected as the President
of India in June 1977. The presidential election was
necessitated by the death of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed in
February of that year.

Downslide of the Janata and Rise of
Congress (I)

The Janata government began with full popular support and
high hopes, but cracks soon started showing with marked
differences on ideological and political lines coming up.
What is more, the concentration of some leaders on revenge
against Indira Gandhi worked against the party and revived
the Congress leader’s popularity. In combination these two
factors worked towards the fall of the first non-Congress
government at the Centre.
Futile Commissions Various commissions of inquiry
were set up to look into alleged malpractices and wrong doing
by Indira Gandhi and her son. The most famous of these was
set up under the chairmanship of Justice J.C. Shah, a retired
judge of the Supreme Court, to enquire into the atrocities
and excesses of the Emergency. Most of the allegations,
however, could not be proved, and few convictions could be
obtained. The cases against Indira Gandhi could not be
maintained as there was lack of evidence.
Belchi and Indira’s Masterstroke Then in May 1977,
came the violence in Belchi, a village in Bihar: a group of

706  

Harijans were burnt to death by a mob from the upper castes,
allegedly over a dispute over land. It may be noted here that
the social set-up in India was undergoing a transformation.
There was a rise to prominence of the backward castes (who
later came to be called the ‘other backward classes’) who
had got rich in the wake of the Green Revolution and the
White Revolution and bought land from the forward castes
and had elected representatives to further their cause.
Unfortunately, they also took this as a licence to act as they
wanted. The Harijans worked on these lands, but they were
at the receiving end of much abuse from the landlords. With
the spread of education and scope for political representation,
the younger among the Harijans, especially, were no longer
ready to meekly accept the ill treatment handed out. They
too gave a fight. There was thus a spurt in caste violence.
The Belchi incident was exploited to her own advantage
by Indira Gandhi. She travelled to Belchi, the last bit on an
elephant as there was no clear path on which to even walk
to reach the village, and showed her sympathy for the affected
people. Besides showing up the Janata government as callous
to the poor and marginalised, Indira Gandhi’s action built up
her own image as a friend of the poor and the Harijans even
as her party members were made to realise that she was the
leader to follow if power was to be regained.
Indira makes Gains Charan Singh’s single minded
hounding of Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay worked in her
favour. Indira Gandhi was arrested on some vague corruption
charges and kept in police custody for a day, after which the
magistrate released her, rejecting the charges as insubstantial.
She was now very much back in the game, and made speeches
critical of the government.
The Congress split once again in January 1978; the
group led by Indira Gandhi becoming the Congress-I (for
Indira). Her party won the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh state
assembly elections, defeating the Janata Party as well as the
rival Congress party. She herself contested elections from
Chikmagalur in Karnataka and won a seat to the Lok Sabha.
Now, a parliamentary committee reported on Indira Gandhi
having misled the house on the Maruti enterprise, and the



 707

house said she should go to jail. She was disqualified from
her seat. However, she won again from Chikmagalur. Indira
Gandhi was now seen as a victim of a witch hunt and her
popularity grew.
Differences within the Janata Party and Fall of
Morarji’s Government The Janata Party was in the meanwhile
disintegrating, with growing factionalism and personal rivalries
overshadowing the efforts at governance. The antagonism
between Morarji Desai and Charan Singh, who was not
satisfied with his second number position in the cabinet, grew
to such an extent that Desai was forced to dismiss Charan
Singh as well as Raj Narain from office in mid-1978. Charan
Singh retaliated by organising a farmers’ protest march to
Delhi in December 1978. In an effort to keep peace, Charan
Singh was recalled to the cabinet by Desai in February 1979
and allotted the finance portfolio as well as the post of deputy
prime ministership. Things, however, failed to move smoothly.
The divide was getting deeper with two sides being formed:
the Socialists siding with Charan Singh and the Jana Sangh
with Desai. There was further the issue of ‘dual membership’
of the Jana Sangh members who maintained their ties with
the RSS. They would not give up the membership of the
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) as they considered it
to be merely a cultural entity. The Socialists and Charan
Singh’s party walked out of the coalition reducing the
government to a minority. Desperate bids to get support from
the Congress factions did not succeed and the Morarji Desai
government resigned in July 1979.

Charan Singh the Prime Minister who
never Faced Parliament

In a brazen show of opportunism, Charan Singh negotiated
with his erstwhile bitter enemy Indira Gandhi to get support
for a government led by him. With a letter of support from
the Congress, Charan Singh was able to convince the president
that he could have a majority in the Lok Sabha. He was sworn
in as prime minister towards the end of July subject to
proving the confidence of the House. So he gave the prime
minister’s speech from the rampart of the Red Fort on
Independence Day but never got to face the Parliament: just
a day before the confidence vote, Indira Gandhi withdrew her

708  

support to his government. Charan Singh had not accepted
Indira Gandhi’s demand that the special courts set up to
prosecute her be disbanded. Charan Singh had no option but
to resign. The president explored other options of government
formation but none was feasible. In the end, Lok Sabha was
dissolved and fresh elections called for. Charan Singh
remained caretaker prime minister till elections could take
place.

Fresh Lok Sabha Elections and End of
Janata Party Rule

Lok Sabha elections took place in January 1980. The parties
in the fray were the Congress (I), Congress (U), Lok Dal,
the new party floated by Charan Singh and the Socialists, and
Janata, now consisting primarily of Jana Sangh and of the
old Congressmen such as Jagjivan Ram and Chandra Shekhar
The presence of the CPM and CPI was only in West Bengal
and Kerala. The Janata Party campaigned again on the planks
of threats to democracy and Charan Singh spoke of power
to the farmers, but this time round Indira Gandhi ignored
ideology and astutely focussed on an issue close to the
people’s heart at the time, namely, the offer of a government
that could govern. The people, tired of the Janata’s lack of
governance and incessant mutual quarrels, gave their mandate
in favour of the Congress led by Indira Gandhi, also thus
endorsing the view that hers was the real Congress.
The Janata Party split into various parties, like Janata
Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Samajwadi Party, etc.

Legacy of the Janata Rule

Short lived its rule might have been and marked by strife
and contradictions within, but the Janata Party government
contributed something valuable to the Indian polity even as
its negative aspects cannot be ignored.
It was the first non-Congress government at the Centre
since India’s independence. It was also the first coalition
dispensation at the central level.
Restoration of Democratic Rights
An unforgettable contribution of the Janata Party government
was the restoration of democracy and civil rights in the
country.



 709

The Janata government was prompt to take steps to
reverse the draconian measures of the Emergency: media
censorship was removed and several controversial executive
decrees were repealed.
It repaired the Constitution from the Emergency
‘depredations’ and revived ‘open parliamentary practice through
its consultative style when repairing the Constitution’ and
restored the independence of the judiciary, as Granville
Austin points out. Arbitrary powers of the executive were
curbed and the power of an independent judiciary restored.
Under the supervision of the law minister, Shanti
Bhushan, amendments were devised to nullify the democracythrottling steps of the Forty-second Amendment. The Fortythird and Forty-fourth Amendments to the Constitutions were
landmarks in India’s political history.
The Forty-third Amendment passed in 1977 deleted
Article 3ID which gave powers to Parliament to curtail even
legitimate trade union activity under the guise of preventing
anti-national activities. Ratified by more than half the states
as required the amendment gave back to the states the
legislative powers to make appropriate provision for antinational activities consistent with the Fundamental Rights.
The power of the judiciary to invalidate laws was restored.
The high courts were given the power of going into the
question of constitutional validity of central laws, thus
making it possible for persons living in distant places to seek
justice without having to come all the way to the Supreme
Court.
The Forty-fourth Amendment of 1978 made the
promulgation of Emergency more difficult than it was. It
would now require the ‘written advice’ of the cabinet and not
the prime minister alone before the president could proclaim
Emergency. The proclamation would have to be approved
within one month of the reassembly of Parliament, and that
too by a two-thirds majority; its renewal would need a
parliamentary vote on it every six months. Furthermore, the
term ‘internal disturbances’ was replaced with ‘armed rebellion’
as a cause for imposing emergency. A special session of the
Lok Sabha could be called one-tenth of its members requesting
the president for the purpose of revoking the emergency;

710  

such a revocation could be achieved by simple majority. It
was also asserted that Article 20 and Article 21 would never
be suspended even during emergency, while other fundamental
rights would not get suspended automatically but would
require a separate order by president. All important, the
emergency provisions could be challenged in courts
The amendment restored the term of the Lok Sabha and
the state assemblies to the original term of five years. The
courts also got back the power to decide the election disputes
of the president, prime minister, speaker, etc.
The president would now be allowed to return the
advice tendered by the cabinet once for a review.
The amendment deleted Article 31, the Right to Property
from the list of Fundamental Rights to become just a legal
right.
Economic Contradictions
The Janata Party had no single ideology; its members were
a mix of veteran socialists, trade unionists and pro-business
leaders. It made the achievement of major economic reforms
difficult. With Charan Singh in a prominent position, it was
inevitable that agriculture and the rural sector got importance.
The Sixth Five-Year Plan (meant for 1978-83 but also
curtailed due to change of regime in 1980), launched by the
government after curtailing the Fifth Plan, aimed to boost
agricultural production and rural industries. It was called the
rolling plan. In aa rolling plan, planning is at three levels:
first, for the current year as decided by the annual budget;
second, a plan for a slightly longer fixed period which allows
flexibility to change priorities as per the need of the
economic and political situation; and third, a perspective plan
which is for 10, 15 or 20 years. There are no fixed dates
and the targets can be revised every now and then as per the
annual reviews which are very important. While flexibility
is a plus point with this type of planning, a major drawback
is that targets are difficult to achieve as they could keep
changing.
With the fiery Socialist George Fernandes in charge
of the industries ministry, the aim was to promote economic
self-reliance and indigenous industries and, if need be, even



 711

expel the American multinational companies, such as CocaCola and IBM (which indeed was accomplished). Such
policies led to a reduction in foreign investment. However,
the problems of resurging inflation, fuel shortages,
unemployment and poverty could not be effectively addressed
as no effective alternative economic policy was evolved to
deal with the economic situation.
The government failed to work on the radical reforms
the party had promised in the run up to the elections.
There were some bright spots. The Food for Work
programme, launched in April 1977 envisaged some of the
stocks of food grains with the government to be used for
payment as wages in kind to workers in rural areas who helped
to build roads and water ponds during the season when
agricultural employment was low.
Madhu Dandavate, also a socialist but on the moderate
side, undertook some important reforms of the railways of
which he was in charge. It was he who initiated steps to
reduce the corruption in ticket reservation. He initiated steps
to repair worn-out tracks. He did a huge favour to the
travellers in the sleeper second class compartments: he
directed that the hard bare wooden seats be cushioned with
two inches of foam.
Foreign Relations
There was a belief that the Janata government would move
closer to the West to compensate for the Indira Gandhi tilt
towards the Soviet Union. The Janata government certainly
tried to improve ties with the US, with the result that the
US president, Jimmy Carter became the first US president
to visit India after Eisenhower. Efforts were made to improve
trade and expand cooperation in science and technology.
However, The Janata government made it clear that it would
practise genuine non-alignment, so maintained cordial relations
with the USSR too, with Morarji Desai and Vajpayee (the
foreign minister) paying visits to Moscow. Representing
India at the UN conference on nuclear disarmament, Vajpayee
continued with India’s earlier policy and spoke in defence
of India’s nuclear programme and its refusal to sign the nonproliferation treaty on the ground of discrimination.

712  

One of the firsts in foreign relations of the Janata
government was the effort at normalisation of ties with the
People’s Republic of China. In 1979, Vajpayee became the
highest-ranking Indian official so far to visit Beijing to meet
the Chinese leaders. Diplomatic ties were re-established
between India and China; ties had been suspended since the
1962 war. The two sides agreed to establish regular dialogue
to resolve long-standing territorial disputes, expand trade and
improve border security.

Social Changes and Movements

The late 1970s, observes Ramachandra Guha, saw a churn in
political and social terms. Politicians seemed to have
abandoned ideology in favour of expediency and the polity
had become fragmented. On the social level the sections of
society that had been oppressed for so long began to assert
themselves, and this led to a certain amount of social turmoil.
There were new social movements, such as the feminist and
the environmentalist. The older movements, such as the trade
union movement, spread out into fresh areas, such as mines,
and there were campaigns for equal wages for men and
women, education, health and safety. The liberated press
wrote at length and on a wide range of subjects. And
technology in the form of the new offset printing presses
helped disseminate the location of newspapers and journals.
Investigative journalism began with its lens on crime and
corruption. Readership expanded, especially in small towns
as did journalism in Indian languages. And a civil liberties
movement became active.
The social classes – the OBCs – had reaped economic
power through the Green Revolution and the land reforms
and also gained political power. (The Socialists and the Lok
Dal were mostly formed of the OBCs.) They now sought a
space in the administrative system. The Janata government
in January 1979 appointed the Second Backward Classes
Commission, popularly known as the Mandal Commission
after its chairman Bindeshwari Prasad Mandal, a former chief
minister of Bihar. Its remit was to examine whether reservation
in jobs for OBCs should be there in the central administrative
system.



 713

Indira Gandhi: the Second
Phase
(January 1980 to October 1984)
In the 1980 General Elections for the Seventh Lok Sabha,
the Congress (I) was returned to power with a strong
majority. Indira Gandhi won from Rae Bareilly in Uttar
Pradesh as well as from Medak in Andhra Pradesh. She chose
to keep the Medak seat. Chosen as the Congress parliamentary
leader, she became the Prime Minister of India once again.
Indira Gandhi trusted very few and had come to rely
more and more on her son, Sanjay, who had also been elected
to the Lok Sabha. She was not ready to share power with
anyone else. But in June 1980 Sanjay died when he tried out
some stunts in the plane he was flying and lost control. And
Rajiv Gandhi, Indira’s elder son, an airline pilot with no
experience in politics, was reluctantly forced into politics.
Soon enough he was elected from Amethi to the Lok Sabha
and most people knew he was their apparent to the Congress
leadership.

Economy

Indira Gandhi paid immediate attention to the economy. The
Janata Sixth Five-Year Plan was curtailed and a new Sixth
Year Plan (1980-1985) was launched. The objectives of the
new Sixth Five Year Plan India were mainly focused on
increasing growth and industrialisation and reducing poverty
and unemployment. There was to be promotion of efficiency
in the use of resources and improved productivity, besides
the strengthening of the impulses of modernisation for the
achievement of economic and technological self-reliance. A
minimum needs programme was envisaged for the
economically underprivileged, designed to ensure that all
parts of the country attained, within a prescribed period,
nationally accepted standards.
The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)
was launched on October 2, 1980 all over the country. The
National Rural Employment Programme (NREP), launched
in October 1980, became a regular programme under the Plan
from April 1981.

714  

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development was established for the development of rural
sector in 1982 on the recommendation of the Shivaraman
Committee.
The Sixth Plan is considered to have initiated the first
steps towards economic liberalisation, with the government
subsequently launching Operation Forward in 1982. They
were the first cautious attempt at reform but they were too
cautious to have much effect. Indira Gandhi was wary of the
multinational companies eroding the country’s self-reliance.
Improvement in the ecological and environmental aspects
of the country was also to be given attention, according to
the Sixth Plan. It is worth recalling that Indira Gandhi had
attended and spoken at the first UN conference on environment
in 1972. In her earlier stint as prime minister, she was behind
the implementation of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972
and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of
1974. The Wildlife Protection Act facilitated the establishment
of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, and Project Tiger
was launched in 1973. Now, in her second stint in power,
the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention
and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 were enacted.

Foreign Relations

Sri Lanka and Tamils Problem In the area of foreign
relations, Indira Gandhi was unhappy with Sri Lanka’s turn
away from socialism after Sirimavo Bandaranaike lost power
to J. R. Jayewardene, who, Indira Gandhi felt was a puppet
of the West. Though it is alleged that India under Indira
supported LTTE militants in the 1980s to pressurise
Jayewardene to be sensitive of Indian interests, the Indian
prime minister refused demands that India attack Sri Lanka
after the incidents of Black July 1983, in which Sinhalese
mobs targeted the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
Pakistan: Siachen Conflict India-Pakistan relations
reached low depths after the rise to power of General
Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan in 1978. It was strongly
felt in India that General Zia supported Khalistani militants
in Punjab. In 1984, there were military skirmishes on the
border. In the end, it became a conflict over the Siachen



 715

India’s Man in Space
It was during the rule of Indira Gandhi that an Indian went
travelling in space. As a part of the joint programme between
Indian Space Research Organisation and the Soviet Intercosmos,
Rakesh Sharma, an Indian Airforce pilot was selected in 1982
as a cosmonaut for a joint Soviet-Indian spaceflight. On April
2, 1984, Sharma flew on board Soyuz T-11 with two Soviet
cosmonauts to the space station Salyut 7. During his stay of
nearly eight days on the space station, he performed certain
experiments in the fields of bio-medicine and remote sensing and
exercises to study the effects of yoga on the body during
weightlessness.
The most memorable aspect of that space mission for many
Indians is the episode of Indira Gandhi asking Sharma, on a hazy
live video link, how India looked from space, and he replied in
Hindi: “Sare jahan se achcha (the best in the world). Today that
would have become viral tweet!

Glacier lying between the Saltoro ridge line to the west and
the main Karakoram range to the east in the Himalayas;
located in the disputed Kashmir region it is claimed by India
and Pakistan. The water melting off the glacier ultimately
feed the Indus, crucial to both countries.
The roots of the conflict lie in the lack of proper
demarcations of the territory on the map beyond the map
coordinate known as NJ9842. Before 1984, neither India nor
Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. However,
in order to reinforce their claim on the area, the Pakistanis
encouraged expeditions to the glacier on the basis of permits
given by their government. Becoming aware of this in about
1978, an Indian Army expedition was also sent to Teram
Kangri peaks as a counter-exercise. To free the glacier from
Pakistani domination, the Indian armed forces launched
Operation Meghdoot in April 1984, and Siachen became the
world’s highest battlefield. India was victorious in the conflict;
two passes, namely, Sia La and Bilfond La, were secured by
India while Pakistan retained control of the Gyong La pass.
Non-Aligned Movement Under Indira Gandhi, India
reasserted its prominence in the Non-Aligned Movement.
India hosted the 1983 summit of NAM at Delhi and thus

716  

Indira Gandhi became its chairperson. She brought attention
to bear on the relationship between disarmament and economic
development. She actively worked to project the need for a
new international economic order that would be of benefit
to the developing countries.

Unrest in States

Political and communal tensions rose in many parts of India
during the second term of Indira Gandhi as prime minister.
Naxalites were once again active in the tribal areas of
Andhra Pradesh.
There was a movement for separate statehood in
Jharkhand region which was then a part of Bihar. Less intense
but very much present were movements for separate states
in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
In Nagaland, militancy reared its head again with Muivah
setting up the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN)
with ideas of separating from India and to that end working
with sparatists from Kashmir and Sikh militants.
There were also movements for greater autonomy for
states even if these states did not desire to leave the Union
of India. The most serious disturbance was in Assam with
the growth of the All-Assam Students Union which wanted
the Bengalis out of the state in fear of being culturally
dominated.
In Andhra Pradesh a new political party under the aegis
of N.T. Rama Rao, a very popular film star, was formed in
1982. The Telugu Desam party spoke for the self-respect of
the Telugu speaking people. And his party came to power
in the state elections at the end of the year.

Punjab Turmoil and Operation Blue Star

The political turmoil was greatest in Punjab with strong
communal overtones to it. In fact, there were many strands
in the turmoil. There was the strident demand for greater
autonomy. Many Sikhs increasingly saw themselves in terms
of their separate religion and resented that a Sikh political
party (the Akalis) could not rule the state on its own free
on central interference; they had waited for a long time to
get a state of their own but Chandigarh was still a shared
territory with Haryana. There was trouble over sharing of



 717

river water as well. In 1973, the Akalis had brought out the
Anandpur Resolution that on one level just demanded greater
autonomy – as did all states. On another level, by using the
term ‘Sikh nation’, it lent itself to the interpretation of
separation from the Indian Union.
The Akalis opposed the Nirankari Sikhs whom they
called heretics. It was in this context that Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale rose to prominence. As a priest and head of
the Damdami Taksal, he spoke vehemently against the
Nirankaris. But he also orated against being slaves in
independent India, andmocked at Hindus as well as the
‘modern’ Sikh. It has been said that Bhindranwale had been
encouraged and built up by the Congress as a counterpoise
to the Akalis. If so, he became a Frankenstein’s monster, and
very soon broke free to create an independent image of
himself. He attracted a large number of followers.
In 1980, the Akalis suffered a blow when they were
dismissed from power in the state and the Congress came
to power.
The impetus to form a state free of India was given
mainly by Sikhs in England, US and Canada. In June 1980,
a group of students meeting at the Golden Temple in Amritsar
declared the formation of an independent Sikh republic –
Khalistan; its president was to be Jagjit Singh Chauhan from
London.
The situation became worse and worse with Bhindranwale
gaining greater power and suspected to be behind several
assassinations of prominent men, including the Nirankari
leaders. The government proved ineffective in bringing him
to book.
In an effort to up the ante against Bhindranwale, the
Akalis became more extreme in their views. Their legislators
resigned en masse from the state assembly on Republic Day
of 1983. It seemed to indicate that their commitment to the
Indian Constitution was not firm.
Bhindranwale, in the meantime, was becoming more
virulent towards the Hindus in his speeches and instigating
Sikhs to violence against the Hindus in order to drive them
out. Conflict between Hindus and Sikhs seemed impossible
in light of the origin of the Sikhs, but it had now come about.

718  

The central government sent a team led by Narasimha
Rao to try to convince Bhindranwale to make peace the
negotiations failed and the law and order situation in Punjab
continued to deteriorate.
Khalistani terrorists, reported to be encouraged by
Pakistan, were slowly entrenching themselves in Punjab and
killings took place to eliminate prominent Hindus and Sikh
officials. In October 1983, a bus was stopped and the Hindu
passengers on it shot. The Centre imposed President’s Rule
on the state. Bhindranwale moved without facing any hindrance
into the Akal Takht, the seat of temporal authority for the
Sikhs near the Golden Temple which was the seat of spiritual
authority. By 1984 beginning, Bhindranwale and his associates
had begun to fortify the Golden Temple complex and arms
and ammunition as well as food stocked. It was all under the
command of Shubeg Singh, once a major general and hero
of the Indian Army but later dismissed from it.
Clearly strong action needed to be taken. Indira Gandhi
gave her permission to initiate Operation Blue Star on the
recommendation of Army Chief A.S. Vaidya. By the night
of June 2, 1984 and June 3, curfew had been imposed on
the state of Punjab, all means of communication and public
travel suspended, and electricity supply interrupted. Media
was strictly censored. It was on the night of June 5 that the
actual army action began with the army storming Harmandir
Sahib under the command of Major General K.S. Brar who
acted under the direction of General K Sundarji. The militants
were not easy to subdue as they had sophisticated weaponry.
In the end tanks had to be used against the Akal Takht before
the army had full control of Harmandir Sahib by the morning
of June 7. Bhindranwale was found dead as was Shubeg Singh.
While many militants were killed, there were also many
casualties among the army personnel as well as civilians.
Aftermath The operation caused great disturbance to
the Sikhs all round the world. Many Sikhs left the Indian
Army. Even mutinies by Sikh soldiers were reported. But
it did put an end to militancy in the state and cleared the
Golden Temple complex of arms and ammunitions, at least
for the present.

But the assassination of a prime minister is also to be
seen as the result of Operation Blue Star. On the morning
of October 31, 1984, while walking over from her house to
her office she was shot by her Sikh security guards, Beant
Singh and Satwant Singh. She was rushed to the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences, but she did not survive. Though
it was generally known that Indira Gandhi had died, All India
Radio and Doordarshan made the official announcement only
in the evening.
The Indira Gandhi era was over. Her son Rajiv Gandhi
was sworn in as prime minister by President Zail Singh that
very evening after Congress leaders unanimously decided that
he should take the post.

Legacy

Indira Gandhi was in power for a long time. As a result of
economic programmes and spread of education, the middle
social castes/classes as well as the lower castes/classes were
asserting themselves and there was a growth in the middle
classes in urban India. One consequence of the changing
social situation was widespread social unrest; there were
caste clashes as well as communal violence.
Though Indira Gandhi was liberal minded and not
discriminatory as a political leader, there was a deterioration
in values of democracy in her time. Indira Gandhi’s style of
functioning began with a reliance on the prime minister’s
secretariat formed of persons she could trust, but who were
also of indubitable integrity and intellect, but went on to
depend more and more on her son and a small coterie. It
was the same at party level: fearing competitive power
centres, she weakened the Congress party structure.
Sycophancy grew, and a party that had developed a wellorganised structure with grassroots presence and a range of
regional leaders across the country gradually lost strong
leadership at state level and gave up the democratic style of
choosing its leader and officials. A member of the Gandhi
family had now become indispensable for holding the party
together. Ideology was no longer the basis of politics. And
this was true of other political parties as well. Corruption
spread, and the state apparatus was more and more manipulated
by the powerful for personal gain.

720  

Indira Gandhi’s grit and decisiveness in the face of
external aggression, however, was exemplary. She showed
that India was not to be bullied and brought the country to
prominence in the world map.

The Rajiv Years
(October 1984 to December 1989)

Problems at the Very Outset

Appointed prime minister after the assassination of his
mother, Indira Gandhi, on October 31, 1984, Rajiv Gandhi
faced major problems from the very outset on the domestic
front.
Anti-Sikh Riots
Even as the news of Indira Gandhi’s death became known,
there were sporadic incidents of violence showing anger at
the assassination—perhaps a spontaneous reaction in the
circumstances. But as her body lay in state at Teen Murti
House (Nehru’s residence as prime minister), these sporadic
incidents had deepened and widened; by November 1 there
seemed to be an organised and brutal mob violence against
Sikhs. There was a continual replay on Doordarshan, the stateowned and only television channel available at the time, of
the crowds filing past paying their respects to the assassinated
prime minister with the grieving son beside the body and the
shots of the crowds outside shouting revenge; this would have
further instigated the mob.
While most of the Sikhs targeted were in the
resettlement colonies in North Delhi inhabited by the poorer
section of the population, there was some looting and killing
in middle and upper middle-class localities, as well. The
mobs, composed mainly of Hindus drawn from the “scheduled
caste sweepers who worked in the city, and Jat farmers and
Gujjar pastoralists from villages on the fringes”, as pointed
out by Ramachandra Guha and many newspaper reports of
the time, killed thousands of Sikhs, burnt their homes and
looted their houses and businesses. Witnesses indicated that
several Congress leaders instigated and encouraged these
mobs. Rumours stoked the violence.



 721

View
Though we boast of being the world’s largest democracy and
the Delhi being its national capital, the sheer mention of the
incidents of 1984 anti-Sikh riots in general and the role played
by Delhi Police and state machinery in particular makes our
heads hang in shame in the eyes of the world polity.
Delhi High Court in 2009

The role of the police and the administration was
shocking; the police either turned a blind eye, refused to take
action or, more reprehensibly, actively helped the mob. The
riots went on unabated for two days. The prime minister and
his home minister, Narasimha Rao, did not call in the army
immediately; the army could have quelled the riots at once
and effectively. It was late on November 2 that Rajiv Gandhi
declared over radio and television that acts of rioting should
be stopped and that these were casting a slur on the late prime
minister. It was only by November 3 that the army got its
orders to take steps to control the situation.
On the birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi on November
19, Rajiv Gandhi in a speech said that when a great tree falls,
the earth around it shakes; it was taken to imply a justification
of the riots. Even if one agrees with the view that the public
anger was great after the assassination, it was an insensitive
remark for a prime minister to make.
The anti-Sikh riots was the official term given to the
violence but many called it ‘genocide’. It was an unforgettable
and tragic blot in the history of India since independence.
The silver lining in an otherwise dark spot in India’s
history lay in the efforts made by many Hindus to hide and
help Sikh families during the rioting.
The Bhopal Gas Tragedy
On December 3, 1984, India faced another great tragedy: a
leak of the toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas from the
pesticide plant of the US multinational company Union
Carbide (UCC) at Bhopal killed thousands and left many more
impaired for life. The gas caused internal haemorrhage, lung
failure and death. Worst affected were the inhabitants of the
villages and slums in the neighbouring areas of the factory.

722  

It was one of the worst industrial tragedies of the world. The
plant should not have been allowed in the city in the first
place; further, it seemed to have disregarded safety measures
several times.
After the disaster, UCC tried its best to disown
responsibility for the gas leak by shifting culpability to the
Indian subsidiary UCIL, stating that the plant was wholly built
and operated by UCIL. Soon after, the first multi-billion
dollar lawsuit was filed by an American attorney in a US
court. And the legal battles and machinations began with the
ethical implications of the tragedy and its effect on the
people being pushed to the background. In March 1985, the
Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act was enacted by the Indian
government so as to ensure speedy and equitable settlement
of claims arising from the accident. As per the act, the
government became the sole representative of the victims in
legal proceedings anywhere in the world. Eventually, all cases
were removed from US jurisdiction and shifted to Indian
jurisdiction. Under the aegis of the Supreme Court of India,
UCC agreed to pay $470 million to the Indian government
to be distributed to claimants as a full and final settlement.
The figure was based on a number of claimants that was on
the lower side, whereas the actual number came to be much
larger.
There were allegations that American pressure and
political influence had resulted in the UCC chairman, Warren
Anderson, being allowed to leave India for the US without
being arrested. The controversy continues and so do the
troubles of the people who suffered from the fallout of the
gas leak and had to do with such low compensation.

The 1985 General Elections

Rajiv Gandhi on assuming the post of prime minister in
October 1984 recommended early elections. General
elections were to be held in January 1985; instead, they were
held in December 1984. The Congress (I) won an
overwhelming majority, securing more than 400 seats, the
largest ever majority in independent India’s Lok Sabha
election history till then. The mandate was partly the result
of sympathy wave and largely from a desire to keep extremism
and separatism down. Rajiv Gandhi, who now assumed the



 723

post of prime minister, was also the youngest person to do
so in India.
The March 1985 elections to assemblies in eleven
states brought the Congress (I) to power in eight of them.

Tackling the Tensions in States

Several ethnic conflicts raged in different parts of the country
when Rajiv Gandhi took over as prime minister. Some of
these were settled but others continued to cause trouble.
Punjab was a burning problem. Akali leaders were freed
and an agreement was signed by the Akali leader Sant
Harcharan Singh Longowal and Rajiv Gandhi in July1985. But
in August Longowal was shot dead. However, state elections
were held in September and in what was seen as a vote against
extremism, the Akali Dal came to power with a comfortable
majority. But militancy was not to end so easily. It reared
its head soon and the Golden Temple was once again being
used by militants. This time round, strong—in fact, even
ruthless—action by the police under J.F. Ribeiro and K.P.S.
Gill brought the situation under control, after Operation
Black Thunder was launched in May 1988 to flush out
militants from the Golden Temple. It was a smoother and
cleaner operation but then there was no charismatic leader
like Bhindranwale this time round to whip up emotions. Even
so, militancy did not quite die down for quite some time
in the state. The Chandigarh issue continues to rankle.
Assam was torn by violent agitation in the 1970s and
the 1980s over the influx of foreigners. Rajiv Gandhi and
the All Assam Students Union (AASU) signed an accord on
August 15, 1985. President’s Rule was removed and elections
held in December. The AASU became a political party—the
Asom Gana Parishad—and contested the polls; it emerged
victorious leaving the Congress far behind.
Yet another agreement was that between the Centre and
the Mizos in 1986 whereby the Mizo rebels surrendered their
arms. Mizoram was granted statehood. The Mizo National
Front under the leadership of Laldenga—once a fiery rebel
calling for secession from India—came to power as chief
minister of Mizoram which became the 23rd state of India
in February 1987.

724  

Problems, however, arose in other parts of the country
as well as in the same states later. The Gorkha National
Liberation Front under Subhash Ghisingh represented the
interests of the Nepali-speaking population in the Darjeeling
district of West Bengal and began demanding a separate state
for themselves. Ghisingh after meeting Rajiv Gandhi was
persuaded to accept an autonomous district council.
Tripura was torn by agitations and clashes between the
tribals and Bengalis who had come into the state after
Partition. The Tripura National Volunteers (TNV) adopted the
way of terrorists intimidating civilians and the police with
kidnappings and murders. In August 1988 a memorandum of
understanding was signed under which TNV decided to abjure
violence, give up secessionist demands and to hold negotiations
for a peaceful solution of all the problems of Tripura within
the Constitution of India. It was agreed by the Indian
government that the seats for the tribals in the legislative
assembly would be increased and that some more villages
would be brought under the purview of the autonomous tribal
councils. The terms of surrender were chalked out through
talks between the Centre, the Tripura Government and the
TNV. The troubles were not, however, quite over.
In Assam there was a violent agitation led by the Bodo
tribals against local Assamese. The leadership was given by
the All-Bodo Students Union. Some kind of resolution of
the problem lay some years in the future.
In Jammu and Kashmir, a different kind of problem
arose. On Sheikh Abdullah’s death, his son Farooq Abdullah
had become the chief minister of the state, but Indira Gandhi
had removed him. Now, with Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister,
the Congress and the National Conference formed a coalition
caretaker government in Jammu and Kashmir in 1986.
Elections were held in 1987. The Muslim United Front
(MUF) formed by a group of Kashmiris who sought greater
autonomy from the Centre was also in the fray. There was
wide ranging rigging in the elections to favour the CongressNational Conference so that the results went overwhelmingly
in favour of that group. This was a most unfortunate thing
to happen; even in fair and free election the Congress-NC
group would probably have won, but now the unfair practices



 725

created disappointment and anger and alienation from the
Indian State. This was the beginning of the militancy in
Kashmir with some of the Kashmiri youth turning to Pakistan
for help.

Positive Steps taken on the Domestic
Front

Rajiv Gandhi as a fresh face in politics came to power with
a lot of goodwill from the people. He tried to change the
way things worked. Within his party he indicated that he
would not tolerate incompetency, corruption, or sycophancy.
He introduced modern managerial techniques and tried to
bring younger, more dynamic people into the decisionmaking process of the Congress. In the long run the effort
did not work. The ‘Congress culture’ was too entrenched, and
even the young who began hopefully were soon drawn into
the old ways.
He tried to cut red tape and make the administration
more open and less rigid.
Anti-Defection Act
One of the first things Rajiv Gandhi did as prime minister
was to get the anti-defection law passed in January 1985.
As a result, an elected member of a legislature at the central
or state level could not join an opposition party until the
next election, or he/she would be disqualified as a member
of the house. The measure was aimed at curbing corruption
and bribery of MPs and MLAs to switch parties so as to
manipulate the numbers in the house to form the government.
Environmental Legislation
An outcome of the Bhopal tragedy was the increase in
environmental awareness and activism in India. Rajiv Gandhi
as prime minister responded positively. In 1986 came the
Environment Protection Act (EPA) under which the Ministry
of Environment and Forests (MoEF) was created with overall
responsibility for administering and enforcing environmental
laws and policies. EPA gave authority to the Centre to issue
direct orders to close, prohibit or regulate any industry. An
enabling law, it delegates wide powers to the executive,
allowing it to make rules to manage different issues. In 1987,

726  

amendments to the Factories Act, 1948 empowered states
to appoint site appraisal committees to guide the location
of factories using hazardous processes. Systems were also
set up to ensure the safety of workers and nearby residents
and emergency disaster control plans specified. By 1989, the
Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules had been
enacted for management, storage and import of hazardous
chemicals. But it would be 1991 before the enactment of
the Public Liability Insurance Act to provide for immediate
relief to persons affected by accidents while handling
hazardous substances.
Improving Local Government
Rajiv Gandhi saw the ineffective manner in which the
panchayati raj system worked in states and tried to amend
the situation through a constitutional amendment that called
for regular panchayati elections being mandatory; the law
could not be passed in his tenure but the effort had been
made, and in the coming years the local government system
would get constitutional sanction.
First Steps towards Liberalising the Economy
The first budget presented by the Rajiv Gandhi government—
by the finance minister, V.P. Singh—sought to remove some
of the controls that were stifling the growth of the economy.
Besides simplifying the licensing scheme, the trade regime
was liberalised with reduction in duties on several import
items and incentives to promote exports. Tax rates were
reduced and curbs on company assets were loosened. As a
result of these steps, business houses did well, and the growth
rate of industry was good. However, the period also saw
businessmen and politicians getting closer with the former
doling out gifts (even of money) that were eagerly accepted
by the latter for favours done. Real estate became a potent
source of corruption and unaccounted money with the
politicians.
However, by the end of his term as prime minister,
Rajiv Gandhi, faced with several problems in the country,
went back to populism. Taxes were increased on consumer
durables and air travel made more expensive. In April 1989,
the National Rural Employment Programme (NREP) and the



 727

Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme (RLEGP)
were merged into a single programme, the Jawahar Rozgar
Yojana.
Technology Missions
Imbued with the desire to reform the socio-economic
situation in India, six technology missions were set up under
Rajiv Gandhi’s direction. The idea was to use science and
technology to tackle under development. The scientific
approach was to be applied for solving problems. The targetoriented projects intended that India should enter the
millennium as a modern nation.
The drinking water mission aimed at using satellites and
the disciplines of geology, civil engineering and biochemistry
in locating, extracting and purifying water so that all people
in the country could have safe drinking water. There were
missions directed towards improving milk yield and health
of cows; expanding the production of edible oil so that
imports could be curbed; improving health of people,
especially through immunisation of children against polio;
and increasing literacy, by spreading the television network
to rural areas and using it as a medium. These were all good
ideas and evolved into other programmes over time.
The best known of the missions was that of
telecommunications. Realising the importance of
communications to reach remote corners of the vast country,
Rajiv Gandhi wanted improvement of service, dependability
and accessibility of telecom across India. Indigenous
development, local talent, and privatisation were part of the
mission. Sam Pitroda, a young US-trained Indian telecom
expert, became Rajiv Gandhi’s adviser on this as well as the
other technology missions; he was made the chairman of the
Telecom Commission. The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam
Limited, popularly known as MTNL was set up.
Computerisation
Computerisation was another field in which Rajiv Gandhi’s
initiative has to be appreciated. His government took steps
to make it easy for largescale computerisation with reduction
of import duties on components so that domestic
manufacturers could increase production. Laws were liberalised

728  

to allow foreign manufacturers to enter the market so that
quality and competitive prices could be ensured. Use of
computers in schools and offices was encouraged. As a result
of these measures, India was soon to emerge as a major
software exporter. Some people have called these steps as
initiating the ‘information revolution’ in India.
Education Policy
In 1968, the government under Indira Gandhi launched the
first national Policy of Education (NPE). In 1986, Rajiv
Gandhi promulgated the new NPE that stressed on “special
emphasis on the removal of disparities and to equalise
educational opportunity”. The policy called for expanding
scholarships, adult education, recruiting more teachers from
among the SCs, incentives for poor families to send their
children to school regularly, development of new institutions
and provision of housing and services. Under the policy, Rajiv
Gandhi included Operation Blackboard to improve the
educational infrastructure at primary schools all over India.
Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), a byproduct of this policy, was directed towards promoting adult
education. The concept of having a Navodaya Vidyalaya in
every district of India was born as a part of the 1986 NPE,
the aim being to provide excellence along with social justice.
These residential schools were meant to provide quality
education free of charge to children of poor families, chosen
by merit, who could stay in the schools.

The Negative Side

There were several areas in which the Rajiv Gandhi government
failed to act in a statesmanlike manner or made grave tactical
mistakes.
The Shah Bano Case
In 1985, the Supreme Court gave a decision in a case
involving a Muslim divorcee, Shah Bano, upholding the
decision of a lower court. The lower court verdict was that
Shah Bano’s erstwhile husband should pay her maintenance
every month while Mohammed Ahmed Khan (the husband)
contended that he had paid three months allowance as
required, according to him, by Islamic law. Invoking Section



 729

125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), the apex court
said that Shah Bano, not having remarried and not in a position
to maintain herself, was entitled to get an allowance from
the ex-husband. The court was clear that Section 125 of the
CrPC would prevail over personal law in case there is a
conflict between the two. The Supreme Court even went on
to say that a uniform civil code, as mentioned in the Directive
Principles of State Policy in the Constitution, would help
national integration.
Conservative Muslims resented the court decision as
interfering with their personal law. Sometime later, an MP
moved a private member’s bill in Parliament to the effect
that Muslims be exempted from the purview of Section 125
of the CrPC. This was opposed by Arif Mohammed Khan,
the minister of state in the home ministry. The bill was
defeated in the House. But dissatisfaction among a section
of Muslims was deep. With thousands of Muslims
demonstrating against the Supreme Court decision, the Rajiv
Gandhi government bowed to the pressure. The Muslim
Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Bill was introduced
in the House in 1986 to overturn the Supreme Court
judgement and a whip issued to Congress MPs to vote in
its favour. The bill was passed, thereby denying divorced
Muslim women the right to claim maintenance under the
CrPC and confining the maintenance to the iddat or a threemonth period. The bill placed the onus of supporting the
divorced wife on her relatives or the Wakf Board.
Arif Mohammed Khan resigned in protest.
The Babri Mosque Gates Opening
In British times, the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya was used by
Muslims for worship; there was a platform outside the
mosque where Hindus worshipped Ram. It was believed that
the place was the birthplace of Ram. In 1949, an idol of Ram
Lalla (baby) is said to have been placed inside the mosque
one night. Hindu devotees saw this appearance of the idol
as a miracle and now wanted the place for worship. In the
wake of disturbances, it was decided by the local authorities
to lock the disputed premises in Ayodhya so that neither
Hindus nor Muslims could use the act of worship to press
their claims.

730  

Appeals were made before Faizabad court that the Ram
Janmabhoomi gates be unlocked on the grounds that it was
the Faizabad district administration, and not a court, that had
ordered its closure. In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
(VHP) and other such Hindu groups launched a campaign to
construct a Ram Mandir at the site. On February 1, 1986,
the Faizabad district judge ordered that the doors to the
mosque be opened so that the devotees could pray. According
to reports at the time, the Congress government under Rajiv
Gandhi ensured that the locks of the mosque were opened
almost immediately after the Faizabad judge’s ruling. Television
cameras were present to cover the opening, suggesting that
the judge’s decision was known by the administration
beforehand.
There was a strong belief that the Rajiv Gandhi
government’s decision in the Ayodhya matter was made to
balance the Muslim Women’s Act by placating the hard core
Hindus. If the Congress thought it could undercut the BJP’s
temple campaign, it was mistaken; the initiative was grabbed
by the Sangh Parivar. The VHP was emboldened and its
attitude hardened: now the demand for the demolition of the
mosque to build a temple at the site became vociferous.
The image of Rajiv Gandhi as a modern forward-looking
leader was tarnished after these two issues. As political
analysts warned at the time, the policy of appeasement of
communities for electoral gains could become a vicious
cycle and cause much damage to the social fabric.
The Bofors Scandal
There was more trouble for the prime minister. In March
1986, India signed an agreement with the Swedish arms
manufacturer AB Bofors (once owned by Alfred Nobel) for
the supply of four hundred 155mm Howitzer guns for the
Indian Army. The deal included an option to license-produce
1000 more guns. The deal amounted to $285 million (about
Rs 1500 crore) which was huge for the time.
Almost a year later, in April 1987, a Swedish radio
report claimed that the Bofors deal involved payment of
bribes to top Indian politicians and defence personnel as well
as Swedish officials.



 731

The Hindu correspondent in Geneva, Chitra Subramaniam,
investigated the matter on behalf of her paper and collected
several documents on the basis of which she revealed that
over Rs 64 crore was indeed paid to some very powerful
people. One name that appeared amidst it all was that of
Ottavio Quattrocchi, an Italian businessman who represented
the Italian petrochemicals firm Snamprogetti and was alleged
to have become a powerful broker between the Indian
government and international businesses, mainly because of
his reported closeness to the Gandhi family. The Indian
Express and The Statesman also carried long reports on what
came to be known as the Bofors scandal.
In the meanwhile, V.P. Singh who had been shifted from
finance to defence also seems to have uncovered details of
corruption in the Bofors deal. V.P Singh was finally left out
of the cabinet. This seems to have increased the suspicion
against the Rajiv Gandhi government, and even against the
prime minister himself. There was scepticism about Rajiv
Gandhi’s declaration in Parliament that no bribe was paid and
no middleman was involved. Rajiv Gandhi who had been
nicknamed ‘Mr Clean’ suffered an irreparable damage to his
image.
In July 1988, Rajiv Gandhi introduced what has been
termed as one of the most draconian bills drafted by the
Indian government. The bill was aimed at checking the
freedom of the press: it provided that an editor or proprietor
of a newspaper/ journal could be imprisoned for ‘criminal
imputation’ and ‘scurrilous writings’, terms which would be
defined by the State. Apparently, he was pushed into
introducing the measure because of the investigative journalism
into the Bofors scandal. The bill was in the end dropped, but
further damage had been done to the image of the government.

Agrarian Unrest

The failure of monsoons still plagued the country, and the
drought in 1987 was severe, causing much rural distress.
Kalahandi district in Orissa was particularly affected. The
discontent in the countryside went beyond the rain-fed areas
to the irrigated areas. Farmers’ organisations were formed.
The most famous were the Shetkari Sanghatana led by Sharad

732  

Joshi, who had once been civil servant, and the Bharatiya
Kisan Union led by Mahendra Singh Tikait. While the
former’s bas was in Maharashtra, the latter covered Punjab
and Haryana. These leaders spoke of a divide in the country
– between the Bharat of villagers and the India of the urban
middle class, with the former getting little attention in the
economic policies formulated by the government. Their
demand was that there should be a higher price for agricultural
produce and subsidised power for agricultural use. In actual
fact, however, these organisations were representatives of the
rich and middle level farmers, not the really poor sections
of rural society. The poor all over India, whether in the urban
or in the rural areas, shared the same problems which seldom
found voice.

Foreign Relations

Rajiv Gandhi set out to improve relations with the US and
expanded scientific and economic ties with that country. His
policies of economic liberalisation and emphasis on
information technology brought him closer to the US and
other western nations. Rajiv Gandhi is said to have used a
direct private channel to Ronald Reagan, the US president,
which led to the cancellation of proposed supplies of
AWACS aircraft to Pakistan.
Despite moving closer to the West, Rajiv Gandhi did
not succumb to pressure on the nuclear non-proliferation
issue which he linked, as Indian policy had always done, to
universal disarmament. In June 1988, at the fifteenth special
session of the United Nations General Assembly, Rajiv
spoke about a world free of nuclear weapons, and put forward
his ‘Action Plan for Ushering in a Nuclear-Weapon Free and
Non-Violent World Order’.
In 1986, the President of Seychelles faced a coup and
sought India’s help. The Rajiv Gandhi government authorised
the Indian Navy to reach the coasts of Seychelles to help
avert the coup in a mission named Operation Flowers are
Blooming.
Then, in 1988, Maldives faced an attempted coup whose
perpetrator was apparently assisted by armed mercenaries of
a Tamil secessionist organisation from Sri Lanka, the People’s



 733

Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). The
Maldives government sought India’s help, upon which Rajiv
Gandhi ordered the deployment of the Indian forces in an
operation code-named Cactus. The coup was averted.
In 1987, India re-occupied the Quaid Post in the
disputed Siachen region in what was termed Operation Rajiv.
In December 1988, Rajiv Gandhi became the first
Indian prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954 to visit
China. In 1986-87, there had been a standoff between Indian
and Chinese troops at Sumdorongchu on the north-eastern
border. However, Rajiv Gandhi’s visit led to better relations.
He had a cordial meeting with Deng Xiaoping who, though
he was not the head of state, or head of government or general
secretary (of the Communist Party), was an all-important
person in China.
India and China signed two crucial agreements to
establish a joint working group (JWG) - to seek fair,
reasonable and mutually acceptable solution on the boundary
question - and a joint economic group (JEG) and agreed to
expand and develop bilateral relations in all fields.
The IPKF Misadventure
Sri Lanka was faced with an ethnic conflict between the
Sinhala majority and the Tamil minority who were inhabitants
mostly of the northern part of the island. After Sri Lanka
got independence from the British, Sinhalese was imposed
as the sole official language in the island country. The Tamils
wanted parity on all fronts with their language given the same
status as Sinhalese. There were protests when discrimination
continued. Opposition to the official repressive measures
took a violent turn. Soon a number of militant groups were
operating in the Jaffna Peninsula against the Sri Lankan armed
forces. Over time, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) became the most prominent under Velupillai
Prabakaran and took over the struggle using violence against
the Lankan forces as well as civilians; their demand had
progressed from autonomy to liberation from the Sri Lankan
government to form an independent Tamil state. Though it
was an internal affair of Sri Lanka, the events in Jaffna raised
tensions in Tamil Nadu, where many felt close to the Sri

734  

Lankan Tamils. The LTTE used Tamil Nadu as a refuge, and
the state government was sympathetic to their cause, even
as the central government kept quiet. It is believed that the
governments under Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
surreptitiously supported the Tamil militants.
When the Sri Lankan forces responded with brutal force
and blockaded the Tamil majority district of Jaffna, Rajiv
Gandhi first tried to resolve the problem diplomatically. But
the siege continued. India hoped the Sri Lankan government
would be amenable to India sending relief supplies to the
beleaguered Tamils by sea. A flotilla of Indian ships with
relief supplies was locked by the Sri Lankan Navy as they
approached the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. On June 4,
1987, the Indian government ordered relief supplies to be
air-dropped into the area on humanitarian grounds—in what
was called Operation Poomalai (also Eagle-Mission-4)—
after warning Sri Lanka not to try and stop the planes.
India was criticised by some nations for the action even
as Sri Lanka accused India of “blatant violation of sovereignty”.
The US expressed regret over the incident but added no
further comment. India wanted the airdrop to send a message;
the siege of Jaffna was lifted, and there was a declaration
of cease-fire.
Indo-Sri Lanka Accord 1987 In July 1987, the Sri
Lankan president, J.R. Jayawardene, asked Rajiv Gandhi to
mediate in the island country’s ethnic conflict. As a result,
the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed by the two
leaders in Colombo on July 29, 1987.
Incidentally, it was on the occasion of this visit to
Colombo that Rajiv Gandhi was assaulted by a Sri Lankan
in the Guard of Honour held for the Indian prime minister
in what seemed an attempted assassination. Rajiv Gandhi
escaped serious injury.
The peace accord was perhaps too ambitious in its
scope, seeking to address three contentious issues: strategic
interests, people of Indian origin in Sri Lanka and rights of
the Tamils in Sri Lanka. Under the terms of the agreement,
the Sri Lankan government would devolve power to the Tamilmajority areas, the Sri Lankan troops would withdraw to their
barracks in the north and the Tamil militants would surrender



 735

their arms. Besides the LTTE being dissolved, Tamil was to
be designated an official language of Sri Lanka. Significantly
the Tamil groups were not party to the talks that led to the
agreement.
It was under the accord that the Indian Peace Keeping
Force (IPKF) was sent to Sri Lanka’s northern and eastern
provinces where the Tamils were in majority, to “guarantee
and enforce the cessation of hostilities” between the Tamil
separatist groups and the government. The LTTE, however,
refused to surrender arms and began threatening Tamils who
opposed the militant group. The IPKF and the LTTE became
involved in a military confrontation.
The IPKF was working under severe strategic constraints.
The scene of action was an island-nation; the war was an
unconventional one being waged against a group that had
strong emotional connections with Tamil Nadu; and the Indian
intervention evoked hostile reaction from the Sinhalese as
well as they felt their sovereignty to be undermined.
Finally the IPKF captured the LTTE headquarters in
Jaffna but the militants retreated into the jungles from where
they used guerrilla tactics to keep the forces at bay. A large
number of Indian soldiers died and the cost of the operation
was huge. Back in India the pressure was on the government
to recall the force.
In the end the IPKF misadventure was to be the cause
for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991 during
his election campaign in Tamil Nadu. At Sriperumbudur, a
woman bent to touch his feet and exploded an explosive
device attached to her. The suicide bomber belonged to the
LTTE and her action was in retaliation of India’s role in Sri
Lanka.

General Elections of 1989

V.P. Singh, on leaving the Congress, floated the Jan Morcha
along with Arun Nehru and Arif Mohammed Khan, both of
whom had parted ways with Rajiv Gandhi. Later, this group
merged with the Janata Party, Lok Dal and Congress (S) to
form a new party, the Janata Dal, with the idea of bringing
together centrist parties opposing the Congress government
under Rajiv Gandhi. The Janata Dal then joined a set of

736  

regional parties (which included the DMK, he Telugu Desam
party and the Asom Gana Parishad) in a coalition which came
to be called National Front.
In November 1989, general elections were held for the
Lok Sabha. By then, the opposition to Rajiv Gandhi had
consolidated, and a coordinated strategy was adopted. The
Congress did badly in the elections, though it still manged
to be the largest single party in the Lok Sabha. People had
lost faith in Rajiv Gandhi in the face of the accusations of
corruption.
The 1989 election was the first in which no single party
got a majority on its own. At that time itself some
commentators indicated that the elections marked a milestone,
the beginning of coalitions and a period of political instability.
Rajiv Gandhi resigned in December 1989. His party
chose to sit in the opposition as it did not have the majority
or the support to form the government after the elections.

The V.P. Singh Years
(December 1989 to November 1990)
The National Front did not have a majority of its own in the
Lok Sabha after the 1989 elections. But it staked the claim
to form the government and did so with the BJP and the Left
parties offering to support it from the outside.
Vishwanath Pratap Singh was sworn in as India’s prime
minister on December 2, 1989.
Rajiv Gandhi, as head of the Congress party, was leader
of the opposition in the Lok Sabha.
Soon, after state legislative elections in March 1990,
the governing coalition at the Centre achieved control of both
houses of Parliament.
One of the first decisions taken by V.P. Singh was to
recall the IPKF from Sri Lanka.
V.P. Singh was prime minister for less than a year but
he faced major problems in that short period.

Kashmir Situation Worsens

In Kashmir, in December 1989, militants of the Jammu and
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) kidnapped the daughter of



 737

Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, the Union home minister. The
Centre capitulated to the demands of the JKLF and released
jailed militants. Another prominent militant group, which was
soon to side line the JKLF, was the Hizb-ul Mujahideen led
by Syed Salauddin with more hard core ideas of turning the
state into an Islamic regime. Salauddin, incidentally, had left
mainstream politics after the rigged elections of 1987.
With armed attacks on banks and grenade attacks on
police stations, the militants were becoming more defiant and
daring. The Centre decided to take strong action and sent in
forces to control the situation. The governor was changed
and Jagmohan was appointed to the post.
A series of incidents turned many Kashmiris into
supporting the militants. ‘Jihad’ became a prominent cry as
religion became an important factor in the militants’ game.
The Hindu minority suffered as a consequence: the Kashmiri
Pandits, who formed an integral part of the Valley and shared
a common culture with the Muslims in that state in almost
every aspect except religion, became the target of brutal
violence with many of them being killed by the militants.
There was an exodus of Pandits from the Kashmir valley to
Jammu and farther afield; they became refugees in their own
land. Many of them still live in refugee camps and makeshift
buildings, afraid to go back.

Implementation of the Mandal Commission
Report

The Mandal Commission appointed during the Janata party
rule had submitted its report in December 1980. The
Congress governments under Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
had quietly shelved the report.
The Mandal Commission or the Backward Classes
Commission – to give it its official name – said that caste
and backwardness were linked, and that the other backward
castes, despite forming a significant proportion of the
country’s population, had very low representation in the
administration, especially at the higher levels. In this context,
the main recommendation made by the commission was that
27 per cent of jobs in the central government be reserved
for these castes beyond the percentage reserved for the

738  

scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The same kind of
relaxation in age was also to be made for the OBCs as existed
for SC/ST in being considered for posts.
V.P. Singh thought it would be a good idea to implement
the Mandal Commission recommendations to gain popularity
with the decidedly large group of OBCs whose importance
as a ‘vote bank’ was not to be ignored. There were rising
politicians from the group, Lalu Yadav in Bihar and Mulayam
Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, the two states that had a
decisive say in most elections in India. A move forward on
social justice-related issues, Singh calculated, would
consolidate the caste coalition that formed the support base
of the Janata Dal in northern India. In this context, it might
be worth noting that in the southern states a large proportion
of government jobs were reserved for the non-brahmins and,
it was pointed out by those who agreed with the Mandal
recommendations, efficiency had not suffered.
On August 7, 1990, V.P. Singh announced in Parliament
that his government had accepted the Mandal Commission
report and would implement 27 per cent reservation at all
levels of central government services for the Socially and
Educationally Backward Classes as identified by the Mandal
Commission.
Large scale protests greeted the government’s order.
There were self-immolation bids and even suicides by
youngsters from the upper castes, as these people felt their
chance of getting government jobs had become more difficult.
The protests were intense in the northern part of the country
while the south was not affected. In the south, with the
reservation policy being in place for quite some time,
youngsters over time had become less dependent on
government for their livelihood as the industrial sector
offered a good alternative for jobs. Also, the proportion of
upper castes in the population in the south was less compared
to the north.
[The matter had been taken to the Supreme Court which
stayed the order. But it was only in November 1992 that the
court gave its decision. Seven judges upheld the
constitutionality of the Mandal Commission as well as the
government order based on its recommendations. Three



 739

judges offered a dissenting view that impersonal criteria like
rather than caste should be used in deciding who was
disadvantaged. The apex court, however, laid down two
conditions: reservations in toto should not exceed 50 per
cent and that caste criterion should be restricted to the
recruitment level and not apply in case of promotions. By
the time the judgement came, most political parties were
reconciled to the reservation order; they realised that opposing
it would prove to be politically harmful. Even the Congress
which had been lukewarm to the matter had realised the
importance of the OBC factor in winning elections in the
north. The Narasimha Rao government which came to power
in 1991had already issued a fresh order in September 1991
in favour of the Mandal recommendations, with a condition
attached that within the 27 per cent reservation preference
would be given to the poorer sections of the OBCs.]

Mandal to Mandir: the Rath Yatra and Fall
of the Government

One issue on which the Bharatiya Janata Party had gained
popularity was the campaign to build a Ram temple in place
of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya. With the implementation
of the Mandal recommendation, the BJP was itself divided
over whether to support the move or oppose it. While some
thought it was a plan to fragment Hindu society, others felt
OBC aspirations needed to be met. The BJP in the end
decided to play the mandir card to mobilise the Hindus.
The party president, L.K. Advani, decided to set out on
a yatra or tour in a rath (which was a van converted to
look like a chariot). The Ram rath yatra beginning in
Somnath in September 1990 was to culminate in Ayodhya
after touring several of the states in between. V.P. Singh
faced a dilemma; whatever he did - stop the procession or
let it continue – would prove counter-productive for the
government. In the end, it was left to the chief minister of
Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, to prevent the yatra from reaching
Ayodhya; he got Advani arrested on the charges of disturbing
the peace and fomenting communal tension and placed under
preventive detention in a guest house when the procession
passed through Bihar.

740  

There were widespread disturbances after many of the
kar sevaks, who were to build the temple, were also arrested
by the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh. Clashes
took place between security forces and supporters of the
mandir and there were communal clashes as well.
The BJP withdrew its support to the National Front
government. V.P. Singh lost the confidence vote in the Lok
Sabha and resigned in November 1990.

The Chandra Shekhar
Government
(November 1990 to June 1991)
With the imminence of the fall of the V.P. Singh government,
Chandra Shekhar and Devi Lal had left the Janata Dal along
with several others who supported him to form the Samajwadi
Janata Party. Once again, the Congress, as in the case of
Charan Singh earlier, offered to support from outside a
minority government, this time led by Chandra Shekhar who
had just 64 MPs with him.
Chandra Shekhar won a confidence motion and was
sworn in as prime minister on November 10, 1990.

Troubled Economy

The economic situation was in a bad shape, and foreign
exchange levels had reduced to a dangerous low. The
economic crisis was mainly due to the large and growing
fiscal imbalances over the 1980s. The loans that earlier
governments under Congress had taken from world financial
institutions and, in Rajiv Gandhi’s case, from the market had
created a huge debt. India was struggling to finance its
essential imports, especially of oil and fertilisers, and to
repay official debt. The situation was made worse because
of the Gulf war and the resultant hike in oil prices.
By January 1991, the Chandra Shekhar government,
with Yashwant Sinha as the finance minister, had convinced
IMF to approve two loans. In return, the government promised
to initiate economic reforms through the budget due to be
presented in February. By the middle of February, it was clear
that the Congress would create trouble. During the motion



 741

of thanks to the president’s speech at the beginning of the
budget session, the Congress withdrew its support to the
government on some flimsy grounds, with the result that the
minority government was unable to present the full budget.
In March 1991, the government was forced to pledge
gold reserves of the country to manage the foreign exchange
situation. According to news reports, economic advisers to
the prime minister pointed out India could use the plentiful
gold that it held. The State Bank of India was asked to put
up a proposal to the Reserve Bank to lease gold confiscated
from smugglers on the government account. The central bank
approved the proposal and the government approved it too.
By mid-March, global credit-rating agencies had placed
India on watch. It was impossible to raise even short-term
funds. In the absence of a full budget and a firm commitment
to reforms, there was no more funding available from
multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.
It was in these circumstances of a severe liquidity crisis
with the possibility of a default in sovereign payments that
Chandra Shekhar, though only a caretaker prime minister at
the time, authorised the decision to pledge the gold to raise
money; it was an inevitable move. Though there was a public
outcry when it came to be known, and criticism that it had
humiliated India, it was this move that helped meet the
balance of payment crisis besides helping the next government
begin its much vaunted process of economic reform.
With Chandra Shekhar’s resignation in March 1991, the
Lok Sabha was dissolved and fresh elections announced.
President Venkataraman asked Chandra Shekhar to continue
as caretaker prime minister till June when the new government
would take over.

Elections of 1991

The first phase of the General Elections took place in May.
Then, on the night of May 21, tragedy struck: Rajiv Gandhi
was assassinated while campaigning in Sriperumbudur in
Tamil Nadu. The next phase of elections were held in June.
In the first phase, voting took place for 211
constituencies while the rest of constituencies voted in June.
The results showed a marked variation between the two

742  

phases: the Congress did not do well in the constituencies
that voted before Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, whereas in the
constituencies that went to the poll after the tragedy the
Congress did remarkably well. The results reflected the
sympathy and horror felt by the people over the young
leader’s assassination. Incidentally, that act by the LTTE led
to the total loss of support for it in India. In the end, the
Congress was the largest party with 244 seats, which,
however, did not reach the level of a simple majority in the
House. The BJP improved upon its earlier tally creditably.

The Narasimha Rao Years
(June 1991 to May 1996)
Pamulaparti Venkata (P.V.) Narasimha Rao was chosen to
lead the Congress (I) after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.
Narasimha Rao was an erudite scholar and knew several
languages, and he was a Congress loyalist. He had held
important ministerial posts – external affairs, defence, human
resources and home – in the governments of Indira Gandhi
and Rajiv Gandhi.
After the elections, he formed a minority government.
Narasimha Rao himself had not contested elections in 1991,
probably with the intention of retiring from politics. But after
he was sworn in a prime minister, he won in a by-election
from Nandyal in Andhra Pradesh to become a member of
the Lok Sabha.
Rao is best remembered for the economic reforms
undertaken by his government; however, he has other
achievements to his credit as well. And a few blots as well.

Economic Reform

On becoming prime minister, Narasimha Rao inducted
Manmohan Singh, a non-political economist who was at the
time Chairman of the University Grants Commission, into
his cabinet as finance minister. He backed his finance
minister in all the steps he took and took a few on his own
as industries minister. He also managed the reactions,
especially within the Congress party, which were not initially
in favour of reform when socialism had been the basic
approach under Nehru and Indira Gandhi.



 743

The economy of India was in shambles. Besides the
precarious balance of payment situation, domestic scene was
not good with high inflation.
When Rao became prime minister, the Soviet economic
model was discredited. China under Deng Xiao Ping had
undertaken market-oriented reforms. Narasimha Rao also
opted for market reforms, but not the free market type; he
opted for the middle path. He focused on reforms that would
produce the least pain to the masses in general even while
producing high growth rates. The government approach was
not radically reformist. There was to be no bank privatisation
or staff reforms. Nor would there be no opening up of the
farm sector.
The New Economic Policy of 1991 aimed at correcting
the weaknesses on the fiscal and balance of payments fronts
to stabilise the economy. On the structural reform side, the
policy sought to remove the rigidities that infested the
various sectors of the economy. An effort was to be made
to control inflation and release industries from unnecessary
controls and regulations so that hurdles in the way of growth
would be removed. The fundamentals of the new economic
model were to be liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation.
The rupee was devalued. Manmohan Singh explained
that this would help export. The budget took a bold step of
correcting fiscal imbalance by reducing the fiscal deficit.
Singh initiated the gradual reduction of import duties, income
tax and corporate tax.
The finance minister with the support of his prime
minister specifically targeted the highly restrictive trade and
industrial policies. The quotas on the imports of most
machinery and equipment and manufactured intermediate
goods were removed. There was a rationalisation of the tariff
structure and reduction in custom duties, especially on capital
goods. Imports of technology were freed.
The Industrial Policy of 1991 was revolutionary for
the times. Significantly, Narasimha Rao himself held the
industries portfolio. The industrial licensing system was
made applicable to a much shortened list of environmentallysensitive or security-related industries. The MRTP Act was
modified to remove sections that restricted growth or

744  

prevented merger of large business houses. The industries
reserved for the public sector was drastically reduced. The
public sector was also granted more autonomy. Private
investment was made welcome in the infrastructural sector.
The restrictions on foreign ownership were liberalised.
Foreign investment was gradually liberalised.
The service sector was also liberalised with private
sector allowed to invest in insurance, banking, telecom and
air travel sectors.
The Rao government abolished the Controller of Capital
Issues which governed capital issues in India; introduced the
SEBI Act of 1992 and the Security Laws (Amendment) to
regulate all security market intermediaries; and started the
National Stock Exchange as a computer-based trading system.
The system may not have been wholly reformed:
because of bureaucratic controls it still took much more time
to start a business in India when compared to China or
Malaysia; labour laws were not reformed, and the process
of exit for losing enterprises continued to be difficult.

Panchayati Raj and Nagarpalika Acts

Though it was Rajiv Gandhi who had initiated the move, it
was during the time when Narasimha Rao was prime minister
that the Panchayati Raj and municipal government got
constitutional status. With the enactment of the 73 rd
Constitutional Amendment, a new chapter, Part -IX, was
inserted in the Constitution of India. A new Eleventh Schedule
covering 29 subjects within the functions of the Panchayats
was also added. The amendment is an implementation of one
of the Directive Principles of State Policy. States have been
given flexibility to take into consideration their geographical,
politico-administrative and others conditions while adopting
the Panchayati Raj system.
With the enactment of the 74th Amendment to the
Constitution, a new chapter, Part-IX A, has been added to
the Constitution. States now have a constitutional obligation
to adopt municipalities as per the system prescribed in the
Constitution.
In both panchayats and municipal bodies there is
reservation for SC/ST and women; this is an attempt to ensure
that there is inclusiveness in local self-government.



 745

Handling Security Issues and Space Tech

The Punjab situation was controlled. Rao went in for state
elections though there were misgivings. It was for the good
as after the 2002 elections, militancy died down.
The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
was passed mainly directed towards eliminating the infiltrators
from Pakistan.
The modernisation of the defence sector was given
importance, and military spending was increased. Prithvi 1
missile was inducted into the army.
It is widely believed that it was Narasimha Rao who
made sure that India’s nuclear programme made progress.
Space technology progressed with the successful tests
of the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle as well as the
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.

Foreign Policy

The Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, and the Indians were
forced to rethink their foreign policy as there was no Cold
War, and bloc politics now had no place in international
relations. India’s relations with the US gradually improved.
But India also tried to build up strong relations with other
nations of the West as well as with japan, Israel, Brazil and
South Africa. Post Cold War, India’s foreign policy became
closely linked with its economic policy.
Rao launched the Look East policy in an attempt to
bring India closer to ASEAN (Association of South East
Asian Nations). The strategy involved the creation of close
economic and commercial ties, bringing about an increased
cooperation in strategic and security matters, and an emphasis
on age old cultural and ideological connections between India
and the region. The policy has over time served to strengthen
India’s political, economic and cultural relations with the
countries of Southeast Asia and the Pacific, besides helping
India become an important part of the economic and security
dynamics of the region. Significantly, the policy was taken
up by governments that came after Narasimha Rao’s.
Rao’s overture to China, which he visited in 1993, and
Iran were useful when Pakistan brought a resolution on India’s
violation of human rights in Kashmir in the human rights body
of the UN: China and Iran did not favour it.

746  

Negative Aspects

There were two main criticisms against Narasimha Rao. One
was that he allowed the Babri Masjid demolition and the other
was corruption.
The Babri Masjid Demolition
In the late 1980s, the Bharatiya Janata Party had raked up
the issue of the Ram Janmabhoomi to its advantage in the
1991 elections. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) was even
more vociferous and aggressive on the issue and began
organising protests and demonstrations in Ayodhya and in
other parts of the country demanding a temple at the site
of the Babri Masjid. There was apparently some demolition
and building at the site earlier itself but the administration
took no notice. Uttar Pradesh was under BJP rule and the
chief minister at the time was Kalyan Singh.
The VHP announced that on December 6, 1992, work
on the temple would begin. Thousands of volunteers – the
kar sevaks – converged on Ayodhya. While the plan announced
was that prayers would be held on a platform near the mosque,
when the time came, groups of kar sevaks were moving
towards the mosque despite being asked not to by the RSS
and the police. The crowd became quite uncontrollable and
not amenable to reason, their one intention being to demolish
the mosque. They were armed with iron rods and other tools
and had soon scaled the mosque walls. The BJP leaders
gathered there, such as L.K. Advani, are reported to have
called these kar sevaks back but to no avail. The police did
little to control the situation. The mosque was soon attacked
and reduced to rubble. The BJP clarified that it was not a
party to the vandalism and that it was an unfortunate thing
to have happened. It was more than unfortunate; it was tragic
and ominous and would have long-term repercussions. BJP
leaders were arrested Communal riots broke out in Uttar
Pradesh and many other parts of the country resulting in many
deaths. Bombay was one of the worst sufferers with the Shiv
Sena stoking the violence. In 1993, there were bomb blasts
in the city at strategic locations orchestrated by a couple of
mafia dons based in Dubai, apparently in retaliation for the
attacks on Muslims earlier.



 747

The fact that Kalyan Singh did nothing to stop the
situation from turning ugly cannot be condoned; as a chief
minister, he was an authority of the State and he should have
upheld the law and enforced it. What shocked many and
aroused criticism was the non-action of the Centre. Surely,
it was pointed out, president’s rule should have been imposed
in anticipation of trouble and central forces should have been
given firm orders to intervene and control the situation.
Maybe the prime minister did not want himself and his party
to be dubbed anti-Hindu by taking firm action. The Uttar
Pradesh government was dismissed and president’s rule
imposed on the state only after the destruction had taken
place.
India’s image was damaged world over because of this
event and its aftermath of riots. There were dire predictions
that India wold be reduced to one of those lawless countries
with ineffective government or become a dictatorship of
some kind. The predictions did not come true, but the Babri
Masjid demolition remains a blot in the history of modern
India that continues to echo down the years ominously. In
society, where there had so far been no open antagonism
between Hindus and Muslims, though a sense of victimhood
was felt by both and communal riots did occur, now there
was open suspicion and even hostility between the two
communities. It would not be fair or true to say that every
Muslim and every Hindu felt that way, but the general
impression to that effect had been created.
Liberhan Commission A commission was appointed
ten days after the Babri Masjid demolition by order of the
home ministry. The one man commission, comprising Justice
Liberhan, a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High
Court, was assigned the task of probing the sequence of
events that led to the occurrences at the Ram JanmabhoomiBabri Masjid complex on December 6, 1992, resulting in
the destruction of the structure. The commission submitted
its report some seventeen years later in June 2009 when the
UPA was in the government.
The commission indicted top BJP leaders, and held 68
people culpable, including L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Kalyan Singh, the then-Chief

748  

Minister of Uttar Pradesh. It identified the Kalyan Singh-led
BJP government in Uttar Pradesh as the key to the execution
of the conspiracy to demolish Babri Masjid. The report of
the commission apparently contained no criticism of the
1992 Indian government and then Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao. It accepted Rao’s contention that it was not
possible to legally and constitutionally impose president’s
rule in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992 before the event.
Corruption Scandals
Till July 1993, the Narasimha Rao government ran smoothly
though technically it was a minority government. But in July
1993, the opposition decided to test the strength of the
government and brought in a no-confidence motion. The
government side on its own did not have the numbers to pass
the test. When the no-confidence motion was put to vote it
was found that some members belonging to the Jharkhand
Mukti Morcha JMM) and the Janata Dal (Ajit Singh group)
had voted against the motion, thus enabling the government
to win the vote and remain in power for the full five-year
term. It was later alleged that the JMM members had been
bribed by Narasimha Rao through a representative.
In 1996, after Rao was no longer prime minister,
investigations in the case took place. A special court
convicted Rao and his colleague, Buta Singh (who is alleged
to have taken the MPs to the prime minister). However, on
appeal to a higher court, the decision was overturned, mainly
due to the doubt attached to the credibility of Mahato who
said he had taken the bribe. Both Rao and Buta Singh were
cleared of the charges in 2002.
Rao’s name was also dragged into the Harshad Mehta
stock market scam and then in the hawala and Lakhubhai
cheating cases. Rao was cleared in both cases.
Rao may not have been convicted in any of the cases,
but in the public mind the whiff of corruption never faded.

Kashmir

Even as Hindu religious feelings were being whipped up in
India by certain groups, there was growing Islamic
fundamentalism in the Kashmir valley. It was in the 1980s
and the 1990s that militancy grew with the active help of
Pakistan. Religious sentiment was intensified and linked to



 749

the liberation of Kashmir from the Indian State. The cry was
for ‘jihad’ and groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba wanted
Kashmir to join Pakistan. This group was rapidly gaining
prominence, trying to suppress other groups such as JKLF
which wanted independence rather than joining Pakistan, and
working for vengeance against India for its role in the
creation of Bangladesh. The fundamentalism was not confined
to fighting the Indian State machinery but extended to
changing the way of life with banning cinema, smoking and
drinking alcohol besides compelling women to wear the
burqa. The Pandits bore the brunt of the actions of the
militants: they were forced to leave their homes and Kashmir
and become refugees.

General Elections of 1996

In May 1996, Narasimha Rao resigned following the
resounding defeat of the Congress in the General Elections.
He also resigned from the post of party chief later.
The elections were fought along three themes – Ayodhya,
economy, corruption. Lines were drawn along religious and
caste; besides the Congress was torn by factions, and many
accusations were made against the Narasimha Rao government
from within the party itself for mishandling situations and
corruption charges. In the circumstances, the verdict was
fractured. No party got enough seats to form a government
on its own.
The BJP won the most seats (161), while its allies
formed of Samata Party, Shiva Sena and Haryana Vikas Party
won a total of 26 seats, thus making the BJP group get a
total 187 seats. The Congress got the second position, while
the National Front composed of Janata Dal, Telugu Desam
and Left Front won 114 seats. Another feature that marked
the 1996 general elections was that several strong regional
and state parties showed no interest in allying with any of
the three main contenders for power.

Rise of the Dalit Voice

Even as political parties were getting to represent people on
the basis of religion and the OBCs, the Dalits (much more
commonly used now than the official scheduled caste or the
Gandhian term ‘Harijan’) were also being consolidated into
being represented by their own party. In earlier times, the

750  

Congress had always drawn the Dalit votes, and after the death
of Ambedkar the Dalits found a leader in Jagjivan Ram. The
Congress in this aspect was challenged only by the Republican
Party in Maharashtra and by the more militant Dalit Panthers,
also in the same state. But alongside, as far back as in the
1970s, Kanshi Ram, having quit his government job, had
mobilised Dalit government employees into an organisation
– the All India Backward and Minority Communities
Employees Federation (BAMCEF). This organisation attracted
a large number of followers. Encouraged, Kanshi Ram started
a political party, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) which, as
indicated by the choice of the name ‘bahujan’, was to
represent not just Dalits but other backward castes as well
as Muslims and other as well over time. The area of influence
was mainly Uttar Pradesh.
The Dalits were drawn by the narrative that the BSP
presented – that the Congress was merely using them as vote
banks whereas the BSP stood for social justice and change
that would take the Dalits along the path of progress. The
BSP fought the 1984 elections but won no seat though it
got quite a few votes. In the Uttar Pradesh state elections
it made an impressive showing. In 1993, the party won more
than 60 seats, mostly drawing away votes from the Congress,
and became a major player in Uttar Pradesh politics alongside
the Samajwadi party and the BJP.
Mayawati, a protégé of Kanshi Ram, succeeded him as
the leader of the BSP. She was the one who built up alliances
with other caste groups and political parties. She won a Lok
Sabha seat in 1989. In 1995, In June 1995, she created
history by becoming the first-ever Dalit woman in India to
serve as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Though her term
in office was short, in later years she was to come back as
chief minister of the state. In 2007 she became chief minister
and this time she stayed in that post till 2012.

Between 1996 and 1999: Three
Prime Ministers
Now began a period of quick change of governments; the
period 1996-1999 saw three prime ministers at the helm.
The BJP won its largest tally so far in the 1996



 751

elections but, even with its allies, it was far from the simple
majority required to form a government on its own. The
National Front emerged as a contender with the agenda of
replacing the Congress or the BJP. The elections also for
the first time showed the strength of regional and state
parties.

Vajpayee’s Short-Lived Term as Prime
Minister

As it was the largest party in the Lok Sabha, the BJP was
called by President Shankar Dayal Sharma to try and form
a government. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya
Janata Party, was elected the new Prime Minister of India,
replacing P. V. Narasimha Rao of the Indian National
Congress in May 1996. However, the party just found no
allies to support it, and Vajpayee resigned after just thirteen
days later rather than lose a confidence vote in the House.
The Congress, as the second largest party, declined the
invitation to form a government.

United Front Government: Deve Gowda
and I.K. Gujral

In the end the United Front, composed of some 13 parties
including the National Front, Tamil Maanila Congress, the
DMK and Asom Gana Parishad, and led by Deve Gowda,
formed the government with outside support extended by the
Congress party. The Communists later joined the government.
The government, however, fell in April 1997 when the
Congress party withdrew its support.
During its short tenure, the government signed an
agreement on confidence building measures with China and
the Ganga water accord with Bangladesh. The government
maintained its refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.
The government, however, fell in April 1997 when the
Congress party withdrew its support. A compromise was
reached so as to avoid elections: the Congress agreed to
support a government led by a new leader. The United Front
elected I. K. Gujral as the new leader, and he was sworn in
as prime minister on April 21, 1997.

752  

I.K. Gujral is best known for what has come to be
known as the Gujral Doctrine. This was a policy which
sought friendship, on the basis of sovereign equality and noninterference, with the neighbouring countries of India. Its aim
was to create an atmosphere of peace in South Asia.
It enunciated five principles:
(i) With the neighbours like Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Maldives and Sri Lanka, India does not ask for reciprocity
but gives all that it can in good faith and trust.
(ii) No South Asian country will allow its territory to
be used against the interest of another country of the region.
(iii) None will interfere in the internal affairs of
another.
(iv) All South Asian countries must respect each other’s
territorial integrity and sovereignty.
(v) All South Asian countries will settle all their
disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations.
Though theoretically praiseworthy, critics have pointed
out that it may not work very well to believe in the ‘inherent
goodwill’ of openly hostile neighbours.
Gujral managed to maintain good relations with the
Congress, which supported his government from outside.
Trouble, when it came, came from within his party. The
Governor of Bihar gave the Central Bureau of Investigation
the permission to take up a corruption case against the chief
minister of the state, Lalu Prasad Yadav in the matter of the
purchase of fodder (what has come to be called the Fodder
Scam). Yadav refused to resign in the face of demands from
within and outside the United Front. Gujral personally told
him to resign. In the end, Lalu Yadav left the party and formed
his own party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal in July 1997.
However, as the new party extended its support to the United
Front, the government did not fall.
The Gujral government took a controversial decision
when it recommended to the president that president’s rule
be imposed in Uttar Pradesh which was then under Kalyan
Singh of the BJP when violence marred the assembly.
President K.R. Narayanan sent it back to the government for
reconsideration. A decision by the Allahabad High Court also
went against the idea of president’s rule in Uttar Pradesh.



 753

Then the Jain Commission which had inquired into the
conspiracy aspects of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination submitted
its report to the government. The government finally tabled
the report in Parliament in November. The report criticised
the DMK for tacitly supporting the Tamil militants accused
in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. This created uproar in
the House and the Congress demanded that the prime minister
dismiss the DMK ministers from his government. Gujral
refused and the Congress party finally withdrew support from
the government on November 28. 1997. Gujral resigned as
a result, tough he continued to be caretaker prime minister
till the next government took over.

General Elections

Fresh elections were held in February-March, 1998. Sonia
Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi’s widow, entered the political fray, and
campaigned for the Congress. It was the fourth time since
1989 when a parliamentary elections yielded a ‘hung’ house,
indicating that the era of coalitions had become established.
The BJP once again came ahead of the other parties
though without a majority of its own. This time round,
however, the BJP had formed an alliance with regional parties
from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa (now
Odisha) and West Bengal. This enabled it to increase its tally
of seats, besides attracting new post-poll allies.

NDA Years
(March 1998 to October 1999)
After the elections of 1998 the BJP joined up with several
regional parties to stake its chance to form the government.
The group became known as the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA). Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the BJP was chosen to lead
the NDA, and in March 1998 he was sworn in as prime
minister, for the second time. The NDA proved its majority
in the Lok Sabha.
The government lasted till April 1999 when the
AIADMK withdrew from the NDA. In a dramatic noconfidence motion in the Lok Sabha on April 17, 1999, the
government lost by a single vote. This loss is generally

754  

attributed to the vote of Giridhar Gamang who, despite having
been chief minister of Orissa for a couple of months, had
not yet resigned from the Lok Sabha, so was technically still
an MP.
With the Opposition not able to come up with an
alternative to form the new government, the Lok Sabha was
dissolved by President K.R. Narayanan, and fresh elections
were held in September-October 1999. Vajpayee remained
caretaker prime minister till the elections.
In the meanwhile, Sharad Pawar and some leaders left
the Congress when the party chose Sonia Gandhi as its head.
The few months the Vajpayee government was in power
were marked by some notable events.

Pokhran II: Operation Shakti

In May 1998, a series of five nuclear explosions was
conducted by India at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range.
This was the second time, the first time being in 1974, that
such devices were being tested. Termed Operation Shakti it
involved the underground detonation of a regular fission
device, fusion devices as well as a ‘sub-kiloton’ device. Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee convened a press conference
to declare India a full-fledged nuclear state. The main
scientists involved were A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (a future President
of India) who was a scientific adviser to the prime minister
and head of the Defence Research and Development
Organisation and R. Chidambaram who was Director of the
Department of Atomic Energy.
May 11, incidentally, is celebrated as National
Technology Day.
The world, especially the US, was shocked, as the
detonations were conducted with utmost secrecy. The relations
between the US and India plunged to an all-time low. The
US implemented the Glenn Amendment for the first time.
Newer sanctions were imposed, and at one point it looked
that relations would never recover.
Pakistan reacted with its own nuclear tests, Chagai I
and II, also in May 1998, as if it were responding in kind
to India.
In June, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution
condemning the Indian and Pakistani tests.



 755

The Lahore Summit

In late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee worked towards a
diplomatic peace process with Pakistan.
The Delhi-Lahore bus service was inaugurated in
February 1999 and Prime Minister Vajpayee travelled to
Lahore by the bus. An attempt was made by Vajpayee now
to begin a new peace process between India and Pakistan so
as to permanently resolve the Kashmir dispute and other
conflicts. At a summit at Lahore in February 1999, Prime
Minister Vajpayee of India and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
of Pakistan signed the Lahore Declaration, espousing a
commitment to dialogue, expansion of trade relations and
mutual friendship, undertaking to refrain from intervention
and interference in each other’s internal affairs, and expressing
a commitment to take immediate steps for reducing the risk
of accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons and
discuss concepts and doctrines with a view to elaborating
measures for confidence building in the nuclear and
conventional fields, aimed at prevention of conflict, reaffirming
their condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations and their determination to combat this menace
and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Kargil War

The bonhomie of the bus and the summit at Lahore did not
last very long. Barely three months after the summit, it was
found that a steady infiltration was taking place into the
Kashmir valley by armed militants and Pakistanis soldiers,
and these intruders had got control of hilltops at the border
and unmanned border posts. It came out later that the
incursion was planned by the military of Pakistan which was
under General Pervez Musharraf, and the civilian prime
minister was only told after the plan was under way. The
Kargil district was the main centre of this incursion.
The Indian Army first came to know of the incursion
from a group of shepherds in May 1999. Swift action was
taken to counter the Pakistani infiltration. Both army and the
air force (with its operation called ‘Safed Sagar’) were
coordinated in their action. (But the military were told clearly
that they were not to cross the Line of Control.) Operation

756  

Vijay was successful and the peaks taken over by the
Pakistanis recaptured. The vantage points included Tiger Hill
in the Drass sector. These points were crucial as they
overlooked the Srinagar-Leh highway which the Pakistanis
aimed at occupying and so cutting off this only all-weather
road link between the two towns.
In June, Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is reported to have
asked the US to intervene, but the then US president Bill
Clinton declined to do so until Pakistani troops were
withdrawn from the Line of Control. Nawaz Sharif ordered
the operation of the Pakistanis to stop. By July 26, the war
was over with India victorious.
The Indians fought a fierce battle in cold and treacherous
terrain and over 500 of the soldiers were killed. The Kargil
victory boosted the image of Vajpayee as a decisive and
sensible leader and also enthused the public with patriotic
feelings.

NDA: Second Stint
(October 1999 to May 2004)
The Kargil war was fresh in the public mind when the country
went to the polls in 1999. There was public support for the
NDA and the prime minister, in particular. The election
results gave the NDA led by the BJP a majority with the
support of new constituents such as the Janata Dal (United)
and the DMK. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as prime
minister for the third time on October 13, 1999.

Economic and Social Steps

The NDA government carried forward the economic reforms
that had been initiated by the Narasimha Rao government.
Infrastructure development got special attention and
encouragement. Telecom, highways – the National Highways
Development Project and the Golden Quadrilateral – got
importance. Rural sector was not ignored: the Pradhan Mantri
Gram Sadak Yojana was launched to improve rural connectivity
with all-weather roads
The services sector was growing and software industry
was given a boost. Outsourcing of work from the West
created tremendous increase in jobs in India.



 757

The government came out with a new telecom policy
that announced a shift from the high fixed licence fee to a
more reasonable revenue-share based fee. The government
also privatised state monopolies such as VSNL and brought
about fiscal changes in the form of duty-free imports.
The Disinvestment Commission was upgraded into a
ministry.
With the economy being opened up, foreign companies
began tapping Indian markets. Indian pharmaceuticals exported
their medicines and brought in precious foreign exchange.
Efforts were made to encourage foreign investment,
especially from Europe and the United States.
The government was instrumental in getting through the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in 2003
to institutionalise financial discipline, reduce India’s fiscal
deficit, improve macroeconomic management and the overall
management of the public funds by moving towards a
balanced budget and strengthen fiscal prudence.
The government tried to spread education through the
Sarva Shiksha Abiyan for achieving universalisation of primary
education.
A highlight of the period was the Constitution 86th
Amendment Act, 2002 which placed the right to education
among the Fundamental Rights in Part-III of the Constitution.

Terrorist Trouble and Relations with
Pakistan

In December 1999, an Indian Airlines flight (IC 814 from
Nepal) was hijacked by Pakistani terrorists and flown to
Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The government ultimately met the
demands of the terrorists and released certain terrorists
including Maulana Masood Azhar from prison. There was no
explanation forthcoming from the Indian government as to
why the external affairs minister personally escorted the
terrorists to Afghanistan to exchange them for the passengers.
Relations with Pakistan dipped.
But again in July 2001, Vajpayee made an effort to
improve relations with Pakistan by inviting Pakistan’s President
Pervez Musharraf to Delhi and Agra for a summit and peace
talks. No breakthrough was possible as Musharraf did not
agree to leave aside the Kashmir issue.

758  

Then in December 2001, came the attack on the
Parliament House in Delhi, which was carried out by Lashkare-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists. Once again IndoPakistani relations dipped. Following this attack and other
terrorist attacks, the government got the Prevention of
Terrorism Act (POTA) passed.

Relations with US

With the US, India improved relations with President
Clinton coming on a visit to India and efforts made to expand
trade and cooperation on strategic issues.

Kashmir Elections

Kashmir went to elections in September 2002 which were
firmly made free and fair with the Election Commission
making its effort in that direction. Despite militants threatening
the people and telling them to boycott the elections, large
numbers of people voted. The National Conference which was
in power was voted out. An alliance of the Congress and
Peoples Democratic Party was voted to power. Mufti
Mohammad Sayeed became the chief minister.

The Downside

In 2001, the defence minister, George Fernandes, was forced
to resign following the Barak Missile Deal scandal and
another scandal involving the supplies of coffins for the
soldiers killed in Kargil. There was also the report of an
inquiry commission that the government could have prevented
the incursion in Kargil.
Then there was the episode of the BJP party chief,
Bangaru Laxman, apparently accepting a bribe which was
videoed and telecast – one of the first sting operations by
the media.
The Godhra incident and the riots that followed put a
blot on the image of India. In February 2002, the Sabarmati
Express caught fire at Godhra (in Gujarat) and several
pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed. It was widely
believed that a mob of Muslims had set fire to the
compartments whereas reports also said the fire started
inside the compartment was due to a gas cylinder or a stove



 759

catching fire. Riots followed, with Ahmedabad and Baroda
being chiefly affected. The riots have been called a pogrom
as Muslims were targeted and the violence was unbelievable.
It recalled the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Narendra Modi, who
was chief minister of Gujarat at the time, was severely
criticised for being unable or unwilling to control the
situation. It is believed that Prime Minister Vajpayee was
deeply disturbed by the happenings in Gujarat and officially
condemned it. It is also believed that he wanted Modi to
resign, but others in the party dissuaded him from pursuing
that.

Significance of NDA

The NDA government lasted almost its full term, the first
non-Congress government to do so. Vajpayee turned out to
be an efficient prime minister, ably managing the coalition
tightrope politics. With the NDA completing its term, it
appeared as if a credible alternative was available to the
Congress at the national level. And this was necessary in a
truly democratic State. Some of the programmes it launched
were noteworthy. Its freeing the economy further helped
India.

2004 General Election

The Lok Sabha term was to end in October 2004, but the
government decided on early polls; the Lok Sabha was
dissolved in February itself and the country went to polls
in April–May 2004. Perhaps the BJP thought that the
government had done exceptionally well and took the slogan
‘India Shining’ seriously and misread the feelings on the
ground. Perhaps it was encouraged by the party’s recent
successes in state assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, and Chattisgarh. Even newspapers and magazines
misread the situation, and predicted that the NDA would win
without difficulty. But the NDA was defeated. It is possible
that the BJP lost the support of a section of the population
because its campaign stressed economic issues rather than
the controversial and ideological questions.
The Congress, led by Sonia Gandhi, emerged as the
single largest party.

760  

The UPA Years
(May 2004 to May 2009; May 2009
to May 2014)
After the elections, the Congress joined up with minor parties
to form the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which
managed more numbers than the NDA. President Abdul
Kalam called the UPA to form the government. The UPA
with external support from the BSP, Samajwadi Party, Kerala
Congress, and the Left parties managed a comfortable
majority.
It was expected that Sonia Gandhi, as party president,
would be the natural choice for the prime minister’s post.
She declined the office, despite dramatic entreaties by her
party members and the allies, stating that she was following
her ‘inner voice’. She nominated Manmohan Singh for prime
minister. She probably understood that her foreign origin
would be exploited by the opposition to create trouble for
the government. She, however, remained Congress party
president and the UPA chairperson.

UPA Government: First Term

Manmohan Singh, former finance minister, who had initiated
the economic reforms when in Narasimha Rao’s government,
was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on May 22, 2004.
He was a member of the Rajya Sabha.
A common minimum programme (CMP) was formulated
to guide the policies of the UPA government. As the
communist parties had an important role in devising this
CMP, the government’s policies were perceived to be ‘leftof-centre’.
Social Welfare Measures
The reformist tendency of Manmohan Singh in the field of
economy was probably curbed by Sonia Gandhi. A National
Advisory Council (NAC) had been formed, which Sonia
Gandhi chaired. This council had, as its members, social
activists with a welfare agenda. The ideas for social welfare
that came from the council needed to be adopted by the
government.



 761

The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)
– to which the name of Mahatma Gandhi was added later to
become MNREGA – was the largest welfare scheme of its
kind in the world; it was started in 2006. It guaranteed rural
households 100 days of paid labour in a year with the aim
of tackling rural poverty. The programme also sought to help
women with one-third of the work mandated for women.
In 2005, the government’s health ministry started the
National Rural Health Mission.
Under the provisions of the Right to Information Act
of 2005, any citizen of India may request information from
a ‘public authority’ which is required to reply expeditiously
or within thirty days. The Act also requires every public
authority to computerise their records for wide dissemination
of certain categories of information so that citizens do not
have to formally request for information.
In 2005, Manmohan Singh’s government introduced
VAT (value added tax) to replace the complicated sales tax.
Foreign Relations
The Manmohan Singh government made efforts for stronger
ties with the United States. The prime minister visited the
US in July 2005 to initiate negotiations over the Indo-US
civilian nuclear agreement. When, in 2006, President George
W. Bush visited India, the declaration over the nuclear
agreement was made. This gave India access to American
nuclear fuel and technology, though in return India would have
to allow its civil nuclear reactors to be inspected by the IAEA
(International Atomic Energy Agency). It was only in October
2008 that India and the US finally signed the agreement after
further negotiations and approval from the IAEA, the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, and the US Congress. With this agreement,
the thirty-year-long ban that the US had placed on nuclear
trade with India came to an end.
Manmohan Singh was adamant over the Indo-US nuclear
deal saying he would not backtrack from an international
commitment even if it led to the fall of his government. In
July 2008, the UPA government faced a confidence vote over

762  

the issue, as the Left parties withdrew support to the
government. The government managed to win the trust vote.
Manmohan Singh tried to ease relations between India
and the People’s Republic of China. In 2006, China’s
President Hu Jintao visited India, and in 2008, the Indian
prime minister visited Beijing. In the process, the Nathula
Pass was reopened in 2006 after having been closed for more
than four decades.
New President
In the meanwhile, in 2007, Pratibha Patil was elected and
sworn in as the President of India, the first woman to hold
the post in the country. Not very well known, Pratibha Patil
was a Congress member, who had been the Governor of
Rajasthan, and a close associate of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
She was favoured by Sonia Gandhi as a candidate for the
president’s post.
Terror Attacks
India faced several terror attacks in 2007–08. Even as
terrorist acts were carried out by Islamic groups, there were
also a number of bomb attacks in which the ostensible targets
were Muslims, investigations into which pointed to the role
of Hindu groups and individuals. In 2006, a series of
explosions occurred at a Muslim cemetery in Malegaon, in
Maharashtra. In May 2007, a blast took place in the Mecca
Masjid in Hyderabad, then in Andhra Pradesh. In 2007, a
bomb exploded at the Ajmer Dargah in Rajasthan. These
blasts claimed many lives.
In February 2007, a blast on the Samjhauta Express took
place as the train was on its way to Attari in Amritsar, the
last railway station on the Indian side. Many Pakistanis were
killed as well as some Indians. Initially, it was reported that
the main suspects in the terrorist act were the Lashkar-eToiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. In 2009, the United States
Treasury and the United Nations Security Council put in place
sanctions on Lashkar-e-Toiba, and Arif Qasmani was named
for having had a part in the Samjhauta Express bombing.
However, in 2011, the National Investigation Agency (NIA),



 763

established after the NIA Bill was passed in December 2008
following the Mumbai terror attacks, accused eight people
of involvement in the Samjhauta blasts. These were all Hindus
with extremist views who were, said the NIA, “angry with
attacks on Hindu temples by jihadi terrorist activities”. They
included Naba Kumar Sarkar, alias Swami Aseemanand,
Lokesh Sharma, Kamal Chauhan, and Rajinder Chaudhary
among others. [In March 2019, however, the four were
acquitted by the NIA court citing lack of evidence.]
There was a series of bomb blasts in 2008 in Jaipur,
the capital of Rajasthan. In September 2008, bombs were set
off in a busy marketplace in Delhi. These acts of terrorism
were carried out by Islamic fundamentalists often aided by
Pakistan. The worst incident was the attack on November 26,
2008, perpetrated by Pakistani terrorists when a group of
these young men went through Mumbai and created havoc.
They entered the prestigious Taj hotel and held the guests
hostage before killing many. They attacked the busy Shivaji
rail terminus, again causing the death of innocent people.
India’s security weaknesses were exposed as these terrorists
had apparently reached the coast of India in a small boat and
entered the country unnoticed. In the end, nine of the
terrorists were killed and one, Ajmal Amir Kasab, was
captured. The captive’s confession confirmed that Pakistan
and, more particularly, the Lashkar-e-Toiba, had masterminded
the attack. [On November 11, 2012, a special court issued
Kasab’s death warrant after a trial. He was hanged to death
after being held guilty of 80 offences, including waging war
against India.]
Situation in States
Before the country went in for general elections, there were
noteworthy changes in state governments. The Bahujan Samaj
Party (BSP), led by Mayawati, won a majority in the assembly
elections and formed the government in Uttar Pradesh. Her
party’s victory is attributed to the fact that it had reached
out to the higher castes among the Hindus besides the
Muslims and not confined itself to the Dalits. After a long

764  

time, the state was free of a coalition government. This
brought stability to the state. In May 2008, the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) made an inroad in the South for the first
time, forming the government in the state of Karnataka. In
Jammu and Kashmir, the National Conference emerged with
the largest number of seats, and formed a government with
the Congress joining as a junior coalition partner. In Gujarat,
Chattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP was in power.
Trouble in Kashmir
Kashmir witnessed unrest once again in 2008. When it was
decided to allot some forest land for shelters for pilgrims
to Amarnath, there were protests in the Valley. There were
counter-protests in Jammu, which was dominated by Hindus.
Several people were killed in police firing. The series of
protests and counter-protests subsided for a time in the
winter before a fresh series or protests erupted in 2010, this
time over a youth killed in police firing. A large number of
people, mostly the young, came out on the streets and they
resorted to throwing stones and rocks at the police. The army
was called in to control the situation, and this served to
increase the resentment of the people. Protests continued
with violence every now and then. The situation worsened
when it was reported that a copy of the Quran had been burnt
by a Christian priest abroad. Protestors burnt down a school
of the Christians. The protestors in Kashmir were getting
more and more influenced by the fundamentalists even as the
central government would not even think of withdrawing the
Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from the state.
The Kashmir situation continues to simmer.

2009 Election and UPA Back in Power
The country went to the polls in April–May 2009 to elect
the 15th Lok Sabha. Posters for the Congress campaign
showed three faces: those of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi
(party president), and her son, Rahul Gandhi (who had become
general secretary of the party in 2007), confirming the hold
of the ‘First Family’ and the dynastic trend in the party. The



 765

main opposition party, the BJP, projected L.K. Advani as the
prime ministerial candidate. (Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not
keeping well by this time.) Several regional parties too were
in the fray, some of them allied with the BJP and some ready
to support the Congress if the occasion demanded.
The election results showed that the Congress was able
to increase its tally of seats, though it could not get a
majority on its own. The reasons for the endorsement
probably were that the middle classes were satisfied with the
economy which was doing quite well, and they favoured the
nuclear deal with the US; the welfare schemes initiated by
the government at the behest of the NAC under Sonia Gandhi
appealed to many in the rural sector, especially the women
and the underprivileged, and had begun to show positive
results; and Rahul Gandhi was expected to and, probably did,
appeal to the younger voters.
The UPA was once again in a position to form the
government. Manmohan Singh was sworn in as the prime
minister on May 22; as per norms, he had submitted his
resignation on May 18 to President Pratibha Patil. Manmohan
Singh, thus, became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal
Nehru in 1962 to be re-elected after completing a full term.
Telangana Issue
The second term of the UPA government was marked by the
agitation for a separate state for Telangana. Before the 2004
elections, the Congress had allied with the Telangana Rashtra
Samiti (TRS) and promised to create a separate state of
Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh if it came to power at the
Centre. The Congress did very well in Andhra Pradesh in the
2009 elections, but the chief architect of that victory, Y.S.R.
Reddy, who was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, was
totally opposed to the bifurcation of the state. In the
circumstances, the Congress government, now in power at
the Centre, went back on its promise on Telangana. [Also
ignored was another promise–that a fresh states reorganisation
committee would be formed to divide up some of the larger
states. This was because the Left, without whose support the

766  

government would not have survived, was strongly opposed
to the idea.]
Y.S.R. Reddy died in an air crash, and the agitation for
Telangana got a fresh lease of life, with the movement being
led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR). In November 2009,
KCR went on a fast unto death in the cause of Telangana
as a separate state; life in Hyderabad was badly disrupted with
KCR’s supporters coming out in thousands to protest. The
government at the Centre gave in and, in December 2009,
announced that the process to form the state was being
initiated. The decision caused much resentment among the
Congress MPs from coastal Andhra, but it had to be accepted
in the end. The Centre appointed a commission headed by
a retired judge of the Supreme Court, B.N. Srikrishna, to look
into the matter of bifurcation. The commission submitted its
report in December 2010 but it was rejected by the TRS.
After much negotiation, Parliament cleared the Telangana Bill
in February 2014. As per the Act, Andhra Pradesh was
formally divided to form the new state of Telangana. While
the two states were to share Hyderabad as capital for ten
years, the Centre was to provide funds to Andhra Pradesh
(also Seemandhra) to build a new capital. [It was only in June
2014, after a new government took over at the Centre, that
Telangana actually came into existence with KCR as the chief
minister.]
Incidentally, in May 2011, there was a historic
development on the state government level. West Bengal,
where the Left Front had ruled without break since 1977
(itself constituting a record), decided to switch allegiance,
and put the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in power. Mamata
Banerjee, who had once been in the Congress but had broken
away to form and lead the TMC, became the new chief
minister of the state.
Social Welfare Measures and Legislations
The UPA government brought in some important social
welfare measures in its second term. The Right of Children
to Free and Compulsory Education Act, known as the RTE



 767

Act, came into being in 2009. The Constitution (Eighty-sixth
Amendment) Act, 2002 had already inserted Article 21-A in
the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory
education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen
years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State
may, by law, determine. The RTE Act, 2009 put in place what
is envisaged under Article 21-A; it means that every child
has a right to full time elementary education of satisfactory
and equitable quality in a formal school, which satisfies
certain essential norms and standards. All private schools
(except those recognised as ‘minority’ educational institutions)
are required to enrol children from weaker sections and
disadvantaged communities in their incoming class to the
extent of 25 per cent of the school enrolment, through the
means of simple random selection. These children are to be
treated on par with other children in the school, but they will
be subsidised by the State. Article 21-A along with the RTE
Act came into effect on April 1, 2010.
An attempt was made to get the bill on reserving 33
per cent of seats in the union and state legislatures passed;
the bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha, but the government
was compelled to shelve it as its own allies, especially the
Rashtriya Janata Dal, refused to support it.
The government was, in a way, forced to formulate the
Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 to deal with sexual
offences against women.
One night in December 2012, a horrific gang rape of
a young woman took place in Delhi. Jyoti Singh, accompanied
by her friend, got onto a private bus, which had some other
men in it. These men, one of whom was a juvenile, with the
collusion of the driver and the conductor, brutally raped and
tortured the woman and beat up the young man accompanying
her as the bus travelled around, even passing police check
posts. In the end, the woman and her friend were thrown out
onto the roadside. They were found by a passerby who
notified the police, and the victims were taken to hospital.
Doctors could not save Jyoti. According to police reports,

768  

Jyoti had bravely attempted to fight off her attackers, hence
she came to be called ‘Nirbhaya’ in the media as the real
name of the rape victim could not be published. (Her real
name was later revealed openly by her mother.) The police
were quick to arrest the six culprits. In March 2014, the Delhi
High Court found all the defendants guilty of rape, murder,
unnatural offences, and destruction of evidence. The high
court confirmed death sentence for all four men convicted
earlier. (The juvenile was tried under a different law and
escaped with a few years in prison, and one of the accused
died in jail.) The case went in appeal to the Supreme Court.
[It was not till 2018 that the case was finally settled. In May
2017, the Supreme Court rejected the convicts’ appeal, and
upheld the death sentence of the four who had been charged
in the murder. The convicts exercised their right to file a
review petition to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court
rejected the review petition in July 2018.]
The gang rape incident led to widespread protests in
Delhi and in many other places in India, in spite of the police
arresting the culprits quickly. (Incidentally, the protests in
India sparked protests across South Asia; marches and rallies
took place in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.)
The demonstrators who came from all walks of life, but
mostly from among the youth, wanted the death penalty to
be meted out to the criminals. The protestors in Delhi turned
violent and clashed with the security forces. The government
was initially high-handed, but ultimately it was forced to
climb down.
The government appointed a three-member judicial
committee on December 22, 2012. It was headed by J.S.
Verma, a former Chief Justice of India and an eminent jurist,
and was asked to recommend amendments to the criminal
law so as to provide for quicker trial and greater punishment
for criminals accused of committing sexual assault against
women. In its report, submitted in January 2013, the committee
was critical of the government, the police, and even the public
for its apathy. It identified ‘failure of governance’ as the



 769

fundamental cause for sexual crime. The committee made
recommendations on laws related to rape, sexual harassment,
trafficking, child sexual abuse, medical examination of victims,
police, electoral and educational reforms.
The committee did not recommend the death penalty
for rapists. It suggested a range of prison sentences–from
seven years to life–for different situations arising from rape
and gang rape. Recognising the need to curb all forms of
sexual offence, the committee recommended suitable
punishments for acid attacks and trafficking. It made it
incumbent on the police to register every complaint of rape.
It called for the police to be sensitised and trained to handle
sexual assault cases appropriately. Civil society, it said,
should report every case of rape that came to its knowledge.
It wanted all marriages to be registered. Under the Indian
Penal Code, though sexual intercourse without consent is
prohibited, an exception is made for sexual intercourse
without consent within marriage. The committee
recommended that there should be no such exception to
marital rape.
Besides suggesting time-bound trials for rape cases and
the need for stringent punishment for all forms of sexual
harassment, including stalking and groping, the committee
also called for a review of the Armed Forces Special Powers
Act (AFSPA) in conflict areas so that sexual offences by
those in the forces are brought under ordinary criminal law.
The panel strongly recommended that ‘law enforcement
agencies do not become tools at the hands of political
masters.’ It pointed out that members of the police force
must understand ‘their accountability is only to the law and
to none else in the discharge of their duty.’
The committee also observed that the primary
responsibility of the judiciary is to enforce fundamental
rights. It called upon the judiciary to be vigilant.
Calling for reforms to deal with criminalisation of
politics, the committee suggested that a candidate be
disqualified from participating in the electoral process for

770  

sexual offences, and that filing of a charge sheet and
cognizance by the court should be sufficient for
disqualification of a candidate.
The committee wanted education facilities to be provided
by the State to the homeless and abandoned children.
In February 2013, the government promulgated an
ordinance amending the Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence
Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act in matters relating to
sexual offences. In March 2013, the Criminal Law
(Amendment) Act was passed by Parliament to replace the
ordinance. Several new sections were inserted in the existing
laws to define and bring within the ambit of law such offences
as acid attack, which would attract a 10-year jail term
extendable to life imprisonment or fine or both; sexual
harassment, with punishment of imprisonment ranging from
1 year to 3 years, fine or both; voyeurism, punishable with
imprisonment from 3 years to 7 years; stalking, punishable
with imprisonment of 1 year to 5 years; and gang rape,
punishable with imprisonment up to 20 years extendable to
life imprisonment. The age of consent has been increased
from 16 years to 18 years. Repeat offences in certain cases
have been made punishable with life imprisonment or death.
Besides, a quick trial and conviction is called for in cases
of rape.
The law has been criticised mainly for not bringing
marital rape within its ambit, and for doing away with gender
neutrality in the cases of sexual offences and rape because
it recognises these offences only against women.
In 2013, the government pushed through the National
Food Security Act and the Right to Food Act. This was
aimed at providing subsidised food grains to the beneficiaries
of the targeted public distribution system. Though it was
pointed out that this kind of distribution may not reach the
targeted population due to the corrupt and inefficient
functioning of the public distribution system, NAC did not



 771

favour the idea of cash transfers/ food coupons. As one critic
has observed, the contribution of the NAC to the agenda of
‘inclusive growth’ was to ensure that inclusiveness was to
be through patronage and protection rather than promotion
of livelihood and employment opportunities for the poor.
Clearly, the government faced some difficulties is reconciling
its own priorities with those of the NAC.
Space Venture to Mars
Amidst all the negative aspects that occupied the political
discussion, it was heartening to watch the success of Indian
space scientists. In November 2013, the first interplanetary
mission of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),
officially called the Mars Orbiter Mission and popularly
known as Mangalyaan, was launched. [On September 24,
2014, India’s space agency became the fourth agency to have
launched a spacecraft that was successful in reaching Mars
orbit, after the Russian, American, and the European space
agencies. What is more, India became the first country to
have succeeded in reaching Mars in its very first attempt,
and at a remarkably low cost.]
Corruption Charges and Lokpal Act
The UPA government in its second term could also be
credited with having got the Lokpal and Lokayuktas bill
passed in December 2013. But here too it was compelled
by circumstances to do so.
The second term of the UPA government was fraught
with allegations of corruption against it. There was a
controversy over the allocation of the 2G and 3G spectrum
(telecom licences), which were alleged to have been given
away at very low rates. In 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor
General’s report seemed to confirm this. Then came the
Commonwealth Games scandal with reports of huge sums of
money changing hands for the procurement of contracts for
various infrastructure projects. While the 2G/ 3G scam could
be laid at the doors of an ally of the Congress, the
Commonwealth Games scam led to a Congress minister. The

772  

report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2012
charged that coal block allocations had led to a loss to the
exchequer because the allocations were based on favouritism;
this report actually cast an aspersion on Manmohan Singh’s
reputation, which had always been that of a clean politician,
as the allocations had been made when the coal portfolio was
with him (2006–2009). The corruption stories were
extensively covered and debated on the numerous television
channels and brought the subject to a large number of people.
Anti-corruption movements became prominent in 2011.
Anna Hazare, a well-known social worker from Ralegaon
Siddhi village in Maharashtra, came to Delhi in April 2011
and sat on a 12-day fast to protest against the corruption in
government and the failure to tighten anti-corruption
legislation. His specific demand was that a Lokpal be
established. Many activists joined him in the protest. ‘India
Against Corruption’ was an organisation created to support
Anna Hazare in his efforts. One of its main founders was
Arvind Kejriwal, a Magsaysay Award winner and an activist
for the right to information movement. Many of its members
were prominent persons in public life–lawyers, civil servants,
and academicians. Large numbers of people, including
celebrities, came out to support Anna Hazare. And the media
coverage added to the importance of the event. The 2011
movement was significant in Indian political history in that
it provided people the opportunity to express frustration.
Most people had experience of having had to bribe officials
and politicians for getting even legitimate work done. A
series of demonstrations and protests against official
corruption took place across India.
The government seemed to be rattled by the protests
and responded by announcing that it would set up a committee
to hammer out a lokpal bill. It said the committee would have
five cabinet members and five persons nominated by India
Against Corruption. Anna Hazare broke his fast and expressed
the belief that the bill would be passed before Independence
Day that year. The committee, however, failed in its effort



 773

as there was deep distrust between the government
representatives and the activists, and they could not agree on
some major aspects.
Soon there was another protest meeting, this time led
by the yoga guru, Baba Ramdev, demanding the repatriation
of unaccounted money from Swiss and other foreign banks.
Though he was not like Anna Hazare in that he had political
ambitions (he was considered close to the BJP), he had a
large following. Once again, there were large numbers joining
in the protest. The government came down hard on the
protestors after its efforts at conciliation failed. Ramdev was
ordered to stay out of Delhi.
The Lokpal Bill, approved by the government in July
2011, was rejected by the activists on the ground that it
excluded several high functionaries from the ambit of the
lokpal’s jurisdiction.
Anna Hazare declared that he would once again go on
a fast in the cause of a better lokpal bill. Now a fiasco
occurred with the government arresting him. Anna Hazare
willingly went to jail and refused bail, and began his fast right
there, putting the officials in a quandary. The streets of Delhi
filled with protestors supporting him. The government had
no option but to release him. Anna Hazare continued his fast
at the Ramlila Grounds. A throng of supporters gathered to
express solidarity. The protests were, on the whole, nonpartisan
with most protesters unwilling to let political parties make
use of them in pushing political agendas. The movement was
nowhere near Jaya Prakash Narayan’s ‘Sampurna Kranti’ (total
revolution) agitation of 1974–77. The difference was that the
protest in 2011 was held in full media glare; after all, the
era of the 24×7 television had arrived. The government failed
in its efforts to move Anna Hazare from his position. In the
end, towards the end of August, Parliament passed a resolution
moved by the then finance minister, Pranab Mukheree, that
a revised Lokpal Bill would be passed, which would meet
the main demands made by Anna Hazare and his supporters.
This led to Anna Hazare breaking his fast.

774  

The Anna Hazare protest did not succeed in making the
government to immediately legislate on the lokpal. Also, the
supporters split on the issue of forming a political party.
Anna Hazare and some of the protesters were not ready to
enter the political arena. However, Arvind Kejriwal was in
favour of entering politics. Kejriwal and some others formed
the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on November 26, 2012. It was
going to create history by getting a stupendous majority in
the Delhi Assembly elections of 2015, decimating the
Congress and reducing the BJP to a few seats.
The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill was first tabled in the
Lok Sabha in December 2011 and, after being passed, was
tabled in the Rajya Sabha in the same month. The vote failed
to take place after a marathon debate. In May 2012, the bill
was referred to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha. In
December 2013, it was passed by both the Houses of
Parliament. On January 1, 2014, it received assent from
President Pranab Mukherjee (who had been elected President
of India in 2012).
The Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013 mandates the
establishment of Lokpal for the Union and Lokayukta for
states to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain
public functionaries and for related matters. The Act extends
to whole of India, including Jammu and Kashmir, and is
applicable to ‘public servants’ within and outside India. The
Act laid out the organisation, jurisdiction, and powers of the
Lokpal.
The jurisdiction of the Lokpal will include the prime
minister. If, however, a complaint is filed against the prime
minister, certain conditions will apply.
The Lokpal will also have jurisdiction over ministers
and MPs but not in the matter of anything said in Parliament
or a vote given there.
The Lokpal’s jurisdiction will cover all categories of
public servants. The Lokpal’s own members have been
included in the definition of ‘public servant’.
Critics have found two important shortcomings in the



 775

Lokpal Act: the Lokpal was not made a constitutional body;
and the judiciary was excluded from the ambit of the Lokpal.
Conditions Before General Election
When the country went to the general elections in April–
May 2014, much of the positive achievements of the UPA
in its second term was relegated to the background, while
the corruption allegations remained in most people’s minds.
The rural sector faced problems. Farmers committed suicide
on a large scale mainly due to indebtedness, crop failure,
drought, and socio-economic factors. Farmer distress did not
seem to have come down even though the UPA government
in 2008 had announced a loan waiver of
` 70,000 crore. The UPA government rolled out several
socio-economic programmes but their implementation was
poor in most cases.
There was also dissatisfaction on a more general level.
Common people were hit by price rise and unemployment,
not to say lack of development. There was what analysts
called ‘a policy paralysis’ in the second term of the UPA
that led to stagnation on the development front, and many
progressive economic ideas remained on paper. The fiscal
deficit and a sharp downslide of the rupee led to instability
in the economy.
It did not seem as if the UPA was coming back to power
in 2014.

The 2014 General Election
The 2014 General Election, according to many analysts, was
fought as if it were a presidential election. However, most
of the elections to the Lok Sabha down the years have been
based on projecting a strong personality: it was Jawaharlal
Nehru’s campaigning which, in the main, drew the people’s
support; then Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi too were the
main draws. Even Sonia Gandhi when she took over the
Congress leadership and campaigned was considered to be
the future prime minister, though there were rumblings about
her ‘foreign origin’. In those times, however, the other parties

776  

lacked a matching figure to project. The Congress now
fielded Rahul Gandhi as the face of the party, who, if the
party won, would be the prime minister. Manmohan Singh
had clearly stated that he was not ready to be prime minister
again. Rahul Gandhi had been appointed vice-president of his
party in January 2013, reinforcing the perception that the
party followed the dynastic path and was full of sycophants.
The BJP, on the other hand, did have a more credible party
structure in place: party decisions were based on discussion
rather than on what a single individual said, party posts were
filled through elections, and at this point of time, there were
several young leaders, including state chief ministers, who
could be projected as a future leader of the country. It was
Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat, who was chosen
as the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP.
Rahul Gandhi, as an opponent of Narendra Modi, had
little political experience, and was a lackadaisical politician
lacking in the skills of an effective speaker. In his years in
the Lok Sabha, he had made no noteworthy contribution. He
was no match for Modi’s oratory skills and his indefatigable
energy as he campaigned through the country. Even as Modi
referred more than once to the dynastic nature of the
Congress leadership, the lustre of the ‘First Family’ was
fading, on the whole, in the public mind. Modi pushed
sectarian concerns that were associated with the BJP to the
back burner and made ‘development’ the plank of his campaign.
The methods of campaigning adopted by the BJP were also
modern; the party made wide and effective use of the social
media, hiring professionals who gave striking slogans and
brought the latest electioneering methods to work for the
BJP. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) cadres went
all out to help the BJP. Also, the BJP fought the elections
as part of the NDA. It made effective alliances with the
regional parties, which were part of the NDA.
The electorate was slowly but steadily changing. The
public, especially the youth, had a new outlook. With growing



 777

urbanisation and accompanying migration, caste equations had
changed. Modi minimised appeals for votes on the basis of
caste. Modi’s firm commitment to development,
industrialisation, and job creation appealed to the young and
inspired hope in the public.
The country went to the polls to elect the sixteenth
Lok Sabha in April–May 2014. When the votes were counted,
the BJP emerged with a majority on its own, with 282 seats.
The Congress won just 44 seats, its worst performance in
elections so far. The BJP showed remarkable success in most
states; the exceptions were West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu,
and Kerala. Its vote share on all-India basis increased from
about 19 per cent to about 31 per cent.

The NDA Government
(May 2014 – May 2019)
Though the BJP had a majority on its own, it did not ignore
its allies; it was the NDA that formed the government on
May 26, 2014. Narendra Modi took his oath as prime
minister along with some members of his council of
ministers; the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee,
administered the oath of office. The venue was the forecourts
of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi. The swearing-in ceremony
was the first where all SAARC heads were invited, and all
attended. A non-Congress government was in power after ten
years, and a single party had a full majority after a long while.
The Modi government declared its intention to adopt
a developmental agenda–Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (roughly
translated, ‘together with all, development for all’). There was
to be greater inclusion, social and financial, and better
accountability and transparency of government working. There
was to be less government and more governance. The
government said it would work for cooperative federalism,
economic prosperity, and improving the image of India in
the world. Its work at the end of five years was a mix of
positives and negatives.

778  

Digital India: a Step Forward in
e-Governance
One of the basic aims of the Modi government was to
encourage electronic governance. Considering the importance
of reducing the paperwork involved in the public - government
interface and thereby lowering the corruption levels, the
Modi government launched the Digital India campaign within
three months of taking office, in August 2014. The success
of several socio-economic and governance programmes,
existing as well as intended to be launched, depended upon
the efficacy of Digital India.
The idea was to electronically empower the Indian
citizen and the economy. The programme was designed to
get all government departments and the people of India to
connect with each other digitally or electronically, so that
governance could be improved. The government also intended
to enhance and improve connectivity of all villages and rural
areas through internet networks.
There is no doubt that e-infrastructure, e-participation,
and government e-services were put in place and made to
work to improve transparency. The Unified Payments Interface
(UPI), a payment system allowing mobile-enabled money
transfers between bank accounts, and the Bharat Interface for
Money (BHIM) for a less-cash economy were developed and
put to good use, and certainly proved helpful to the citizens.

Socio-Economic Policies and Programmes
of Importance
The NDA government under Narendra Modi took some
noteworthy steps in the economic field. While some of the
policies leveraged past ideas, such as Aadhaar or the Goods
and Services Tax (GST), other ideas, like demonetisation and
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, were new.
Disbanding Planning Commission and Setting up
NITI Aayog
Almost one of the first acts of the NDA government was
to scrap the Planning Commission and set up in its place



 779

the NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog.
The Independent Evaluation Office submitted an assessment
report to Prime Minister Modi on May 29, 2014,
recommending that the Planning Commission be replaced
with a ‘control commission’. The union cabinet scrapped the
Planning Commission in August 2014. On January 1, 2015,
after a cabinet resolution was passed to replace the Planning
Commission with the NITI Aayog, the formation of the NITI
Aayog was announced by the Government of India. This body,
too, like the Planning Commission was established by
executive order. The NITI Aayog was conceived as a policy
think tank of the Government of India. Its aim was to enhance
cooperative federalism by fostering the involvement and
participation of state governments of India in the economic
policy-making process using a bottom-up approach. It, unlike
the Planning Commission, would not allocate funds to the
states for different programmes. NITI Aayog comprises, in
the main, the Prime Minister of India as the chairperson and
a governing council comprising the chief ministers of all the
states and Lt. governors of union territories.
JAM Trinity: Jan Dhan-Aadhar-Mobile
The NDA government was instrumental in bringing about an
important reform which was given a catchy abbreviated form,
JAM, for Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, and mobile number. The
reform was to directly transfer subsidy to the beneficiary.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was announced
by the prime minister in his Independence Day speech, and
it was launched on August 24, 2014. It was one of the largest
schemes in the world for financial inclusion, directed towards
helping those persons so far without a bank account to open
a bank account (without minimum balance requirement), get
a debit card, and access to social security schemes like
insurance and pension. There is no doubt that the scheme
served to bring about a huge increase in bank accounts being
opened, and over the years bring in a considerable amount
of money into the formal banking system. The first steps of

780  

moving unbanked Indians towards organised finance were thus
taken. Criticism that privacy and security are affected need
to be addressed, but the advantages of the poor getting access
to modern finance cannot be denied.
A tool for identity mapping that was launched by the
UPA in January 2009, Aadhaar was strengthened and
institutionalised by the new government. The Unique
Identification Authority of India was established as a central
government agency with the objective of collecting the
biometric and demographic data of residents, storing them
in a centralised database, and issuing a 12-digit unique
identity number called Aadhaar to each resident. Aadhaar was
put to use by the NDA government in improving the delivery
of services to the citizens. The NDA government managed
to get Parliament to enact the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery
of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act
in March 2016. The Centre began identifying the recipients
of the LPG subsidy by insisting that consumers link their
gas connections and bank accounts to their Aadhaar.
Though the Supreme Court restricted the use of Aadhaar
to welfare schemes in which the people receive benefits from
the government, the system brought down wastage and
corruption in the transfer of benefits.
Several subsidy schemes that had been designed to
ensure a minimum standard of living to the poor took
different routes to reach the beneficiary. The Centre and the
states supplied rice, wheat, pulses, cooking oil, sugar, and
kerosene at heavily subsidised prices through the PDS.
Power, fertilisers, and oil were sold below market prices to
certain sections of the population. The MGNREGA operated
through the panchayats which paid minimum wages to the
workers. As these subsidies made their way to the target
beneficiary, there were leakages on the way, with corruption
and inefficiencies reducing the final amounts. The JAM
trinity was intended to reduce the leakages and ensure that
the real beneficiaries got their due by doing away with the
intermediaries: Aadhaar would help in foolproof identification



 781

of the correct citizens, while Jan Dhan bank accounts and
mobile phones would facilitate direct transfers of funds into
the targeted person’s accounts. To get the money into
people’s hands, greater use of mobile payments technology
was to be used. Transfer of money could be quick as well
as secure and convenient through use of mobiles. Over time,
if leakages are stopped and savings for the government
increased, the burden on the taxpayer would go down.
Moreover, with lower subsidies and fiscal deficit, India’s
international credit standing would improve.
Health Policy
A new National Health Policy was launched in January
2015. Government spending was not increased; instead the
role of private healthcare organisations was emphasised. In
this, the Modi government showed a different path from that
of the UPA government, which had supported programmes
to assist public health goals. Several national health
programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco
use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged
with the National Health Mission. In 2018, the Ayushman
Bharat programme, a government health insurance scheme,
was launched.
On October 2, 2014 was launched the Swachh Bharat
Mission (Clean India Mission), Prime Minister Modi’s
flagship sanitation campaign, the belief being that sanitation
was basic to ensuring good health. It was a nation-wide
campaign in India aimed at cleaning up the streets, roads, and
infrastructure of India’s cities, towns and rural areas, and
doing away with manual scavenging. The main aim was to
make the country free of open defecation to which purpose
government encouraged the building of toilets. In 2018, the
World Health Organisation said thousands of deaths from
diarrhoea were averted in rural India after the launch of the
sanitation mission.
Steps Directed Towards Economic Reform
The Modi government’s economic policies focused on
liberalising the economy. The foreign direct investment

782  

policies were liberalised to allow more foreign investment
in several industries, including in defence and the railways.
Well aware that the job situation was not good and that
India’s demographic dividend could rapidly turn from an asset
to a liability, the Modi government initiated the Make in
India scheme in September 2014. It was a flagship programme
to boost the domestic manufacturing industry and attract
foreign investment in the Indian economy. Along with it many
other programmes were also put in place, such as Start Up
India, Stand Up India, Skill India, and so on. The success
of these programmes was not up to expectations, but they
did make some progress.
Parliament amended the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act 1996 to expedite the arbitration of commercial disputes.
The amended law tackled issues of conflicts of interest and
brought disclosures by arbitrators into the ambit of the law.
Time limit was set on the arbitration procedure.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was a new law
enacted in 2016 to consolidate the existing laws related to
insolvency in India and to simplify the process of insolvency
resolution so as to enable easy exit in cases of insolvency
of individuals and companies. This law replaced several
overlapping provisions contained in various laws, such as the
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985,
the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions
Act, 1993, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (also
known as the Sarfaesi Act), and the Companies Act, 2013,
among others. With the new law in place, banks and other
creditors could hope to recover their loans from the bankrupt
companies in a time-bound and efficient way, entrepreneurship
could be promoted, availability of credit could be maximised,
and a balance of the interests of all the stakeholders
maintained.
Unaccounted money has been a bane of Indian economy.
The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act



 783

of 2016 tightened the law in the use of unaccounted, taxevaded money for what is known as ‘benami’ transactions
through the purchase of property. Under the amended law,
authorities were empowered to provisionally attach and
eventually confiscate benami properties. Jail terms of between
one and seven years and a fine are prescribed for offenders.
The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act
of 2016 was another policy initiative of the NDA government.
As per the law, a regulator–the Real Estate Regulatory
Authority (RERA)–was to be established in every state to
oversee the sector and “protect the interest of consumers
in the real estate sector” through an adjudicating mechanism
and appellate tribunal. It was made mandatory for every real
estate project to be registered with its state’s RERA.
Unfortunately, this law required to be enforced by state
governments.
The Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA) which
came into force in April 2018, was required to tackle the
large fraud cases reported by banks. Under the law, if an
economic offender flees the country to avoid due process,
he/she can be declared a ‘fugitive economic offender’ and
their properties can be confiscated and auctioned to recover
at least part of the debt.
The government adopted the Hydrocarbon Exploration
and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016 with the major
guiding principles of enhancing domestic oil and gas
production; bringing substantial investment; generating sizable
employment; enhancing transparency; and reducing
administrative discretion. The policy envisaged providing a
uniform licence for exploration and production of all forms
of hydrocarbon, such as oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc.,
instead of the earlier system of issuing separate licences for
each kind of hydrocarbon; an open acreage policy, i.e., giving
the option to a hydrocarbon company to select the exploration
blocks throughout the year without waiting for the formal
bid round from the government; easy-to-administer revenue

784  

sharing model; and the freedom to market and price the crude
oil and natural gas produced (subject to a ceiling price). This
policy was in keeping with government’s stated intention of
‘Minimum Government Maximum Governance’.
On November 8, 2016, a controversial and the most
criticised step of the Modi government was taken when the
prime minister in a sudden address to the nation announced
that the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would cease
to be legal tender with effect from that midnight. The step
of demonetisation was taken suddenly so as to catch on the
backfoot the corrupt who held on to unaccounted money, and
to curb the fake notes and terror financing from across the
border. The impact of the project was mixed at best. Sudden
withdrawal of notes led to problems on the ground besides
the hardship borne by ordinary people as they sought to
exchange the old notes for new. Real estate was adversely
affected, growth slowed due to reduced demand, supply
chains were disrupted, and uncertainty increased, at least in
the short term. There was a decline in cash-sensitive stock
market sectoral indices like realty, fast-moving consumer
goods and automobiles, small and medium enterprises, and
the informal, cash-driven economy suffered greatly. The
agricultural sector was also adversely affected because
transactions in this sector are heavily dependent on cash.
Critics pointed out that, in essence, demonetisation had
not met the government’s goal of wiping out black money
from the Indian economy. But the move succeeded in that
it brought most of the cash into the formal system. At least
some of it could have been unaccounted, which could now
be tracked. Among the positive impacts of demonetisation
one can point to the increase in AUM (assets under
management) of mutual fund industry. The government
managed to widen its tax base, leading to an increase in the
tax revenue. People began to increase bank balances instead
of hoarding cash (even if legitimate) in different corners of
the house. People also began to turn to the digital payment



 785

systems. At another level, demonetisation proved that Indians
can adapt to changes, and it made people financially aware
about the different spending options. Even the local traders
selling from their carts quickly and smoothly switched over
to e-commerce payment systems.
The Modi government tried to bring in black money
through several schemes, none of which were amnesty
schemes. One was the Income Declaration Scheme (IDS)
in 2016. The other option was the Pradhan Mantri Garib
Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) launched in December 2016 after
demonetisation, which provided an opportunity to declare
unaccounted wealth and black money in a confidential manner
and avoid prosecution after paying a fine of 50 per cent on
the undisclosed income. Reportedly, a total 64,275 people
disclosed Rs 65,250 crore under the IDS while assets worth
Rs 5,000 crore were declared under the PMGKY. In 2015,
the government had enacted the Black Money (Undisclosed
Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act
under which the government provided a one-time window for
compliance.
It is doubtful if demonetisation had an adverse effect
on the BJP politically. In elections to state assemblies held
in 2017, the BJP and its allies won the required majorities
to form the government in six out of seven state legislative
assemblies, and among these was the most populous state
of Uttar Pradesh.
The biggest reform push of the Modi government came
in the form of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). It
overhauled the Centre-state financial relations in a major way.
The move towards GST began long ago, but was expressed
by the then union finance minister under the UPA in his
budget speech for 2006-07. At the time, the proposal was
opposed by many political parties, including the BJP. The
government then could not push it through. The NDA
government achieved something noteworthy in getting the
states to cooperate in the effort to introduce GST, considered

786  

to be biggest tax reform since independence. It was in 2016
that the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment)
Act could be enacted after duly being ratified by the required
number of states, after which the GST could be launched.
It changed the system of how the Centre and states taxed
goods and services and shared the revenue. After the GST
was in place, imposition of taxes on goods and services was
not to be through legislation but was placed in the domain
of the GST Council that consisted of the central and state
finance ministers. GST replaced a number of central and state
taxes, and eased the flow of goods across state borders. It,
however, left five petroleum products and alcohol for human
consumption out of its ambit. There were glitches in
implementation, and frequent changes as directed by the GST
Council. It was criticised for the inept implementation as well
as for the huge compliance burden for small enterprises in
its initial launch. But such a major step was bound to have
certain problems.
Efforts were also made to tackle the non-productive
assets of public sector banks.
Farmers
Problems in the agriculture sector increased over the years.
So many years after independence, Indian agriculture still
depended on monsoons, and proved to be a gamble. The
Narendra Modi government had declared its intention of
doubling farmers’ income in real terms by 2022, moving
away from the historical focus on increasing production.
New crop insurance scheme and higher funding for irrigation
to counter weather risks were announced by the NDA
government.
Several schemes were rolled out for the agriculture
sector. The government tried introducing some new ideas at
the beginning of the term, such as neem-coated urea, soil
health cards, and crop insurance, but the crisis in agrarian
sector was not resolved. A number of marketing reforms
were initiated to create ‘one nation, one market’ in agriculture.



 787

An attempt was made to get farmers to sell online. But as
the subject of agriculture is a state subject, reforms needed
to be endorsed by the states. The APMC Act could not be
reformed.
The government agreed to the demand for a higher
minimum support price. In 2019, it announced the central
sector scheme, ‘Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PMKISAN)’. The aim was to supplement the financial needs
of the farmers in procuring various inputs to ensure proper
crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the
anticipated farm income. This followed the announcement in
the interim budget of February 2019 that farmers with less
than five acres each, who account for over 85 per cent of
India’s farm holdings, would get Rs 6,000 each annually.
Over the years, India became self-sufficient in food
grains, but a large number of farmers remained impoverished.
The sector suffers from some basic problems which no
government has been able to tackle. The young gradually left
farming as an occupation preferring to migrate to the towns
and cities. Suicides by farmers, mainly because of indebtedness
and crop loss due to vagaries of weather, did not abate.
Infrastructure
The Modi government did well in the infrastructure sector:
the speeding up of highway construction, the new Bharatmala
and Sagarmala projects, the building or revival of regional
airports and regional air connectivity, the Udaan scheme, and
much work on modernising and expanding railways are all
achievements to its credit. The Ujala LED bulb scheme may
have been started by the previous regime, but the Modi
government expanded the scheme and halved the price of each
bulb.
Welfare Schemes
The NDA government delivered on a large number of
important public goods schemes, some of which were built
on the initiatives of the previous government, and others of

788  

its own design. The major positive aspect of the programmes
conducted by the NDA government lay in its implementation
which was more efficient.
As part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana initiative,
the number of rural houses built increased considerably with
several beneficiaries getting their due. There was also a large
push on rural electrification to ensure all villages had an
electricity connection by 2018 under the Deen Dayal
Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. Under the Ujjwala Yojana,
the government aimed to provide LPG connections to below
poverty line households in the country to replace polluting
cooking fuels used in rural India with the clean and more
efficient liquefied petroleum gas.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme was launched
in 2015 with the aim of reducing the female infanticide rate
by encouraging education and welfare of the girl child. Also
launched in 2015 was the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, the
primary objective of the scheme being the promotion and
implementation of the welfare programmes for the girl child.
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) had been criticised by
Modi when the UPA was implementing it. But after coming
to power, the Modi government did not discontinue the
scheme, but improved it in various ways, especially by
focusing on productive work to be undertaken, geo-tagging
the assets created under the scheme in an attempt to bring
transparency at the click of a button and check leakages.
Several pension schemes which had been initiated by
earlier governments were continued with modifications, and
some new ones were begun.

Security
Tackling Maoists
The Maoist threat seems to have been suppressed in many
regions where they were operating earlier. Chhattisgarh,
however, faced Maoist attacks every now and then. But the



 789

situation improved in recent years. While Maoist-led violence
remained a major concern in Bastar division, significant
progress has been made in restricting Maoists to the state’s
southern districts. Improved road connectivity and better
equipped and trained security forces helped to improve the
situation.
In 2015, the government had launched a National Policy
and Action Plan for the security and development of areas
affected by Naxalite/Maoist insurgency, and for improving
the training and equipment of the security forces. In the wake
of the demonetisation drive, there was a halt in insurgent
activity, as funds had, indeed been squeezed out.
In May 2019, however, an IED blast was carried out
by Maoists in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. The Maoists targeted
an anti-insurgency operations team. Gadchiroli and Gondia
have areas contiguous with the Dandakaranya region of
Chhattisgarh.
Kashmir Situation and the Pakistani Involvement
The situation in Kashmir cannot be discussed without
considering the actions of Pakistan. The volatile security
scenario in the Indian state is a manifestation of Pakistan’s
proxy war with India, combined with the unsettled political
issues of the state.
In November-December 2014, elections were held to
elect the Jammu and Kashmir state assembly. The regional
People’s Democratic Party (PDP) emerged as the single
largest party but could not form a government on its own.
It was only in February 2015 that the BJP and the PDP
decided to join together to form a government. In March,
the coalition government was sworn in, and for the first time
the BJP was part of a government in the state. Mufti
Mohammed Sayeed of the PDP became the chief minister.
But in January 2016, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed died, and this
created problems for the coalition as the mufti’s daughter
and successor as head of the PDP, Mehbooba Mufti, was not
keen to take the post of chief ministership in association

790  

with the BJP. As the alliance seemed to be in a crisis,
Governor’s rule was promulgated. With the problems
somewhat ironed out, Mehbooba Mufti took her oath as chief
minister of the state in April 2016, the first woman to hold
the position in the state.
Street protests started in Kashmir in July 2016 following
the killing of Burhan Wani, a commander of the Hizbul
Mujahideen, by security forces. Curfew was imposed but the
protesters defied curfew and indulged in stone pelting against
security forces and police. Indian security forces, trying to
control the protesters, used pellet guns, which, although
considered ‘non-lethal’, caused permanent eye damage in
many cases. This only worsened the situation. In August
2017, Abu Dujana, the Pakistani commander of banned terror
group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and his aide Arif Nabi Dar, were killed
after a gun battle with government troops in Kashmir’s
Pulwama district. There were violent protests over this too.
Differences in the coalition government came to the
fore. Ultimately, the uneasy coalition came to an end in June
2018 when the BJP pulled out of the government. The
immediate cause for the break between the two parties lay
in their differences over the continuation of the Ramzan
ceasefire. The militants continued with their terror tactics
even during the ceasefire: the several terror incidents included
the murders of journalist Shujat Bukhari and of Army jawan
Aurangzeb. The union home minister was firm that terrorism
had to be dealt with, ceasefire or no ceasefire. The alliance,
in any case, had no ideological affinity and even lacked
functional coordination. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti
tendered her resignation. The state was later placed under
Governor’s rule again.
In the meanwhile, terrorist attacks on Indian forces took
place every now and then. The Pathankot Air Force Station
was attacked in January 2016, purportedly by terrorists
belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed. On June 25, 2016, a
Central Reserve Police Force convoy was ambushed en route



 791

from Pantha Chowk to the town of Pampore, in Pulwama
district, for which the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba
subsequently claimed responsibility. Early morning on
September 18, 2016, four heavily armed persons entered the
administrative block of the army camp in the Uri sector,
some 100 km from Srinagar, and killed a number of soldiers.
It was the most serious attack on an army camp in 26 years.
After a gun battle, all four terrorists were killed. Jaish-eMohammed was suspected of being involved in the attack.
India conducted surgical strikes in retaliation on September
29, 2016, against terrorist launch pads across the Line of
Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Indian Army said
that a number of militants were neutralised in the operation.
However, this did not act as much of a deterrent as, on the
night of October 3, 2016, terrorists fired at and lobbed
grenades on a Rashtriya Rifle battalion in Baramulla. The
attackers were reported to have been Pakistani nationals
belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad. The border continued to be
tense for some time, with several attacks being perpetrated
by the Pakistanis and the Indian side forced to return fire.
On February 14, 2019, a convoy of the Central Reserve
Police Force (CRPF) was the target of a bomb blast when
it was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber in the
Pulwama district on the Jammu Srinagar Highway. The attack,
said to be the deadliest against Indian forces in Kashmir in
decades, killed 40 CRPF personnel besides the attacker. The
Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the attack.
In the early hours of February 26, Mirage fighter jets
of the Indian Air Force (IAF) took off from various air bases
in India and crossed the Line of Control in Jammu and
Kashmir, and targeted the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in
Balakot in the Khyber Pakhtunwa province with missiles.
India termed the airstrike an ‘intelligence-led, non-military,
pre-emptive’ operation. According to IAF briefings to the
government, 80 per cent of the bombs had been successful
in hitting the targets and had inflicted the requisite damage

792  

to the enemy locations. Pakistan’s military, however, said that
the damage was just to an uninhabited wooded hilltop area
near Balakot. International media too said that the attacks did
not hit the said target, as satellite pictures showed structures
standing intact. There was some confusion on the issue as
media was not allowed near the said spot by the Pakistani
authorities till April. In its report, the IAF observed that the
Spice bomb that was used in the attack penetrates a target
killing people inside rather than inflicting damage to the
outside of a building. So the IAF did not have much evidence
by way of pictures to prove that the Balakot strikes actually
took place, the report said. A fragmentation bomb would have
flattened the structures that would have been easier to present
as evidence, it said.
The Balakot airstrike pushed India and Pakistan to the
brink of an armed conflict. Pakistan Air Force attempted
retaliatory strikes on February 27, 2019. The IAF scrambled
its fighter jets in response, leading to a dogfight between
the Indian and Pakistani jets in the skies over Jammu and
Kashmir. An IAF MiG-21 Bison fighter jet shot down a
Pakistani F-16 during the dogfight. But the MiG too was shot
down and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman,
was captured by Pakistani forces. He was released two days
later, thus lowering the tension between India and Pakistan.
In the wake of the skirmish, both Pakistan and India
blocked airspace for each other. The closure of Pakistani
airspace led to considerable losses for carriers – Indian and
international - flying to the west of India as the flights were
forced to take a longer route. Pakistan also lost the money
that it would otherwise have earned from route navigation
and airport charges levied on flights using its airspace or
landing for maintenance or refuelling. It was in July 2019
that the airspace was opened.

Foreign Relations

India’s foreign policy did not shift drastically on the NDA
government’s coming to power in 2014. However, a subtle



 793

shift did develop over the years. As India’s foreign secretary,
Vijay Gokhale, observed, “India has moved on from its nonaligned past. India is today an aligned state — but based on
issues.”
Sushma Swaraj, one of the senior most leaders of BJP,
was placed in charge of the external affairs ministry in 2014,
becoming the first woman in India to hold independent charge
of the ministry. However, the prime minister was always
closely overviewing the sector. Not only Sushma Swaraj but
also Prime Minister Modi visited several foreign states and
attended international summits.
An important plank of Modi’s foreign policy was to
improve relations with neighbouring countries. The
government’s ‘neighbourhood diplomacy’ was successful in
improving relations with Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal
with Bangladesh in the matter of some enclaves, which had
been initiated by the UPA government but left pending. But
relations with Pakistan saw a plunge, as discussed in the
previous section. With China, there were glitches but the
talks between the two countries were maintained and the
situation kept under control.
A major stand-off between India and China came in
2017 over Doklam. Doklam is an area of some 100 square
kilometres, comprising a plateau and a valley, located at the
junction between India, Bhutan, and China. The Chumbi Valley
of Tibet, Bhutan’s Ha Valley and Sikkim surround it. In 2017,
the Chinese tried to construct a road in the area, and Indian
troops, called in by their Bhutanese counterparts, objected
to it, resulting in the stand-off. Doklam is strategic for India
as it is close to the Siliguri Corridor, which connects
mainland India with its north-eastern region. Bilateral ties
were also affected over the US$ 60 billion China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of the Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI), a project pushed by President Xi
Jinping of China to consolidate China’s influence in the
world.

794  

With the United States, relations had already been
improved by the earlier governments. Modi used his decisive
mandate to further the partnership with the US. He was able
to get the US president, Barack Obama, to visit India and
gave an impetus to bilateral relations to get that country to
invest its capital and technology in India’s development
effort. Modi succeeded in getting the US to sign the bilateral
Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement in 2016 for
facilitating logistical support, supplies, and services between
the militaries of the two countries. Then, in 2018, the
Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement
(COMCASA) was signed to facilitate access to advanced
defence systems.
With the advent of Donald Trump to the post of US
president, the protectionist turn in US trade policies, to an
extent, tempered Indo-US relations. Even so, the US remained
supportive of India, and the bilateral relationship survived.
India agreed to be part of the quadrilateral involving
the United States, Japan, and Australia.
Though the early steps towards a partnership with Tokyo
began under the Manmohan Singh government, the relationship
progressed greatly under Modi. Japan and India have become
indispensable partners in the ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’, and
this is important to the United States as well. Japanese
security is, no doubt, founded in its alliance with the US,
but in counterbalancing China, Japan sees in India a vital
complementary partner.
The proactive nature of the NDA government’s foreign
policy is to be seen in turning the ‘Look East Policy’ into
‘Act East Policy’, which envisages the need to expand the
Indian influence in East and Southeast Asia.
In West Asia, India managed to maintain a balance
between Palestine and Israel without preference. India
succeeded in getting invited to the Organisation of Islamic
Cooperation (OIC) for the first time since its inception. India



 795

reached out boldly to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates with the idea of gaining politically and economically.
In the long term, India, fighting the threat from cross-border
terrorism, was bound to gain from the Gulf monarchies’
growing opposition to Islamist terrorism.
India joined the Australia Group, which aims to prevent
proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, and will
ensure a more secure world. With this, India had become
a member of three of the four nuclear export control
regimes. Earlier, India joined the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) in 2016 and the Wassenaar Arrangement
(WA) in 2017. India’s membership bid for the Nuclear
Suppliers Group (NSG) was pending as China opposed India’s
bid.
India took a leading role in the establishment of the
International Solar Alliance along with France to tackle the
challenge that faces the planet, global warming and climate
change.
Opponents of Modi may snigger at the bear hugs and
the selfies with world leaders, but beneath all that lay an
astute approach to foreign relations. The Modi government
“redefined strategic autonomy as an objective that is attainable
through strengthened partnerships rather than the avoidance
of partnerships.” The global scenario today is complex, and
a country’s approach has to be flexible. So, India’s engagement
with the so-called Quad enhances its strategic autonomy with
regard to China, and when it confers with Russia and China
for a trilateral, it enhances its strategic autonomy in relations
to the Trump administration which seeks to challenge the
basic tenets of the global economic order.

Social Situation
Communal riots were practically nil in the Modi regime, but
there is a clear perception that the activities of a number
of Rightist Hindu nationalist organisations increased and
occupied centre stage after Modi became prime minister, and

796  

it seemed with the tacit support of the government. A
programme for Hindu religious reconversion (Ghar Wapasi),
a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of what was
termed ‘love jihad’, and sporadic praise for Nathuram Godse,
who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, were some activities that
adversely affected the social fabric. The anti-Romeo squads
in Uttar Pradesh were raised ostensibly to protect women
from harassment, but indulged in moral policing. Campaigns
against so called love jihad, though short lived, were an
infringement on the freedom of choice.
Individual Muslims were increasingly targeted for violent
attacks for alleged cow slaughter in the main, but also for
other reasons. Non-Muslims–especially Dalits and tribals–
were also attacked on flimsy charges. A disturbing aspect
of these attacks was that sympathetic observers videoed the
lynching and uploaded it on social media. Some rightist fringe
elements certainly assumed that they had the tacit support
of the government in this violence. But in-depth historical
research is needed before one can categorically assert that
lynching increased under the Modi dispensation. If society
was polarised between Hindus and Muslims by the BJP, only
Muslims should have been lynched and only for cow slaughter.
But one cannot then explain the rise of lynching of individuals
on charges such as ‘child-theft’ and witchcraft.
The stupendous increase in the internet use coincided
with the rise of BJP to power. The ubiquitous use of the
smartphone and cheap internet connections became a common
phenomenon only after 2010. In some cases, it appeared as
if the entire episode of lynching was being played out for
an audience. As, indeed, it was, because a video would be
uploaded for everyone’s edification. Before the era of hand
held mobiles, it would take hours, if not days, for messages
to spread about ‘wrong-doings’ of any person. However, postmobile revolution, in just a few minutes the message gets
spread. Hence, mobilisation is quicker. WhatsApp was made



 797

use of in the most deplorable way to spread such messages.
The proliferation of ‘fake news’ also became common.
Hyper-nationalism seemed very visible. On the social
media, trolling and rise of vigilante groups with little regard
for human life were evident. Vigilante groups mushroomed
with political agendas to attack minorities.
The Supreme Court intervened and directed the
government to take firm action on lynching and give guidelines
to the authorities on steps to take to prevent it, and what
to do when such incidents took place. It called for
accountability from the officials.
Amidst all this, the prime minister remained silent for
too long. Maybe things would have been different if he had
reined in the fringe elements and reassured those facing
violence at the first sign of trouble. Some political
commentators have suggested, however, that the violence by
some radical Hindu nationalists was aimed at undermining
Modi’s authority.
In spite of stricter laws, greater awareness and even
campaigns, violence against women was unabated. Cases of
child rape shocked the nation. The government responded by
introducing the death penalty for rape of minors below 12
years, and provided for all rape cases under the stringent
POCSO Act to be fast-tracked. However, law can only do
so much in cases of rape and violence against women and
children; attitudes of people and society in general need to
change. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies need to be
sensitised.
Several socially important legislations were passed
under the NDA government, such as that on juvenile justice,
child and adolescent labour, and mental health which
decriminalised attempt to commit suicide.
Another landmark was the decision by the Supreme
Court constitutional bench marking the first step in the
struggle by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer

798  

(LGBTQ+) community to gain social legitimacy.
Homosexuality, as embodied in Article 377, much of which
was a relic of Victorian British times, was decriminalised
by the court. It was in 2001, that the issue of constitutional
legality of Article 377 was first raised by the Naz Foundation
in the Delhi High Court, which held the penal provision to
be illegal in 2009, but that judgement was overturned by the
Supreme Court in 2013. In 2018, the apex court overturned
its own earlier stance. An August 2017 judgement of the
Supreme Court upheld the right to privacy, and this laid the
legal ground for a fresh interpretation of Article 377 in the
matter of decriminalising homosexuality. However, other
issues such as same sex marriage, inheritance of property,
and civil rights were not considered. Surprisingly, most
political groups welcomed the decision, which marked a
change from earlier times.
The judgement of Supreme Court in the Sabarimala
Temple case got a mixed response. The decision allowed
women of all ages to go on the pilgrimage. While this
certainly supported the constitutional principle of equality,
it went against age-old traditions. Opposition to the judgement
was vocal and led to widespread protests in Kerala.
The Supreme Court also decided that the practice of
triple talaq among Muslims was not to be allowed. While
women generally welcomed this, conservative elements
opposed it. The government’s effort to legislate on it to make
the practice unlawful did not succeed, and it took the
ordinance route.
All this shows the Indian society in transition.
On another level, the Modi government disappointed.
In the matter of job creation, there was little progress. A
large proportion of India’s labour force continued to be
unskilled and poor. Unemployment rate was reported to have
reached a very high level. The government did not succeed
in rejuvenating the manufacturing sector in industry to create



 799

jobs in spite of the Make in India initiative. But here too,
like in agriculture, the reasons were many and complex. The
low levels of skills among India’s workers, available jobs
being low paid, poor infrastructure, and India’s antiquated
labour laws were some factors.

General Election and Return of
the NDA
April-May 2019 saw the Indian electorate casting votes to
elect the 17th Lok Sabha. The elections were held in seven
phases, and the votes began to be counted on May 23.
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) got an overwhelming
majority, winning 353 seats; the BJP on its own garnered
303 seats, a majority on its own. This was better than their
performance in the 2014 elections, a feat none could have
predicted. The BJP, for the first time made, striking inroads
in West Bengal. Also, it did well in states which had just
recently ousted the BJP in favour of the Congress in
assembly elections. This reflected in the main the voters’
perspicacity: they were clear about who would be better at
the state level and who they wanted at the national level.
The Congress did better than in 2014 by winning 52
seats, while its other UPA allies won 33, but the picture was
clear: the NDA had returned to power at the Centre.
A landmark was achieved in 2019: not only the largest
number of female candidates stood for election, the number
of women who actually won was also the highest ever.
This was the first time a non-Congress government that
had completed a full term returned to power for a second
consecutive term with a majority in the Lok Sabha. Modi was
the first BJP leader to have been elected for the second time
after completion of a five-year tenure, a feat achieved before
him only by two Congress leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru and
Indira Gandhi. Manmohan Singh also was prime minister for
two terms but his party had not won a majority on its own.

800  

Narendra Modi was administered the oath of office as
prime minister by President Ram Nath Kovind on May 30,
2019 in the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan. Guests from
abroad included leaders of the BIMSTEC, the Kyrgyz Republic,
and Mauritius.
Even though the BJP had the required numbers to form
the government on its own, it decided to accommodate its
allies in the council of ministers. One surprise was the
induction of S. Jaishankar, former foreign secretary, as
foreign minister, but then he was well known for his
diplomatic skills and had played a crucial role in foreign
policy even under the Manmohan Singh government. Amit
Shah, BJP president and Narendra Modi’s close associate,
who must be credited with leading the BJP to impressive
victories in election after election, was also included in the
cabinet as home minister.
Narendra Modi, in his speech to the new MPs, asked
the members to work in the government without discriminating
against anyone and win the trust of minorities. He said that
the minorities had been cheated by the other parties for
generations. Pointing out that the minorities had been made
to live in an ‘imaginary fear’ for long, he said that this should
be changed; he affirmed the need to win the ‘vishwas’ (trust)
of Muslims. Sabka Vishwas would be added on to Sabka
Satth, Sabka Vikas. Apparently, Modi had become far more
self-confident of steering his party and his government in
the direction he wanted without the constraints of the
ideological rigidities of the Sangh Parivar in this respect. In
this context, it may be recalled that, as Gujarat’s chief
minister for three terms, he had subdued the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad and other such organisations in the state. He had
already made a crucial statement–that everyone should be
taken along, even those who had not voted for the ruling
alliance and had been its vociferous critics.

Factors behind the NDA Victory

The NDA victory for a second consecutive term was no doubt
won mainly through the hard work of the cadre of the BJP



 801

directed by the strategy devised by Amit Shah. The BJP was
also able to take its allies along with it, despite disagreements
expressed by some of them before the polls.
The BJP had an undisputed leader in Narendra Modi, its prime
ministerial face. The opposite alliance, if it could be called
that, had no alternative to project as Rahul Gandhi of the
Congress was not a unanimous choice. Nor could the
opposing parties agree on a credible alternative. Nor did all
the opposing parties agree to join an alliance.
The campaign was not just aggressive but often
degenerated into the abusive. But perhaps the Congress’
favourite slogan of ‘Chowkidar chor hai’ indicating that the
prime minister was a thief, did not go down well with the
public which thought it showed disrespect to the country’s
prime minister and not just the individual, Modi. To an extent,
this backfired on the Congress, especially as the perception
of the prime minister in the public mind was one of a hard
working non-corrupt man. The Rafale deal somehow did not
seem such a great disaster or something that had led to Modi
making money out of it.
The welfare schemes that the Modi government
implemented fairly efficiently certainly helped the NDA win
a second term. True, the promises fell short, but even the
people who had so far not got a gas connection or a toilet
built had hope that if some people had benefited, in time
others too would get there.
A large section of the population were convinced that
the other parties wooed the minorities just for votes, and
in the process ‘appeased’ them. The Hindutva plank certainly
played a role in the support enjoyed by the BJP. But it is
also to be noted that the BJP was able to cut across caste
divisions to get the majority it did.
The firm way in which the government seemed to have
handled Pakistan – the surgical strikes and later the air force
strike in Balakot in February 2019 – turned the tide in favour
of the NDA in a big way. There is no doubt that national

802  

security was a big issue pushing into the background important
issues, such as slowing economic growth, joblessness, and
farmers’ distress. It did not help the opposition in that it
chose to question the government on its achievement; it
seemed as if it was questioning the army’s capability.
The huge victory of the NDA, however, should not blind
us to the fact that the opposition in Parliament has been
reduced commensurately. A democracy can be healthy only
if there is a strong opposition to question and keep in check
the executive.
